# American Community Survey Methodology

## Survey Types

### ACS 5-Year Estimates
- Based on 5 years of collected data
- More reliable for small areas
- Available for all geographic levels
- Updated annually

### ACS 1-Year Estimates  
- Based on 1 year of collected data
- More current but less reliable
- Only available for areas with 65,000+ population
- Higher margins of error

## Statistical Reliability
- Margins of Error (MOE) indicate estimate reliability
- Coefficient of Variation (CV) = (MOE/1.645)/Estimate
- CV < 15%: Reliable
- CV 15-30%: Use with caution  
- CV > 30%: Unreliable

## Geographic Hierarchies
- Nation > Region > Division > State > County > Place/Tract > Block Group
- Different variables available at different levels
- Smaller areas have larger margins of error
