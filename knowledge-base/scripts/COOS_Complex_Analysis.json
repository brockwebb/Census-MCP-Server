However, it can be derived by summing relevant categories in B08301. The complexity is 'complex' because it requires both a conceptual mapping (what counts as sustainable) and aggregation across multiple variables. Table mapping needs correction: B08301 is the relevant table, not the empty list provided. The concept is feasible but requires careful definition and calculation."

The Census doesn't directly measure 'access to transportation options' but does collect commute data, vehicle availability, and travel times that could serve as proxies. The concept needs operationalization - what specific metric constitutes equity? The composite method is appropriate given the multi-dimensional nature, but specific tables and calculations must be defined. The empty census tables array indicates incomplete specification. This would require complex multi-table analysis combining transportation behavior (B08xxx series), income (B19xxx), and race (B02xxx) data to create meaningful equity measures."
