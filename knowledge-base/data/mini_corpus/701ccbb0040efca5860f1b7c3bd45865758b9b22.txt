We ask questions about home heating fuel to create statistics

about home energy use.

These data are used in government programs that analyze

community air quality and energy needs. Federal agencies use

these statistics to forecast future energy demand, analyze the

fuels available to community residents, and plan and fund

programs that help low-income residents afford to heat their

homes.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci

and law enforcement.

Question as it appears on the form

We ask one question about fuel used to better understand how people heat their homes.

The results from this question are compiled to provide communities with important statistics about housing
characteristics. You can see some of these published statistics here for the nation, states, and your community.

Home heating fuel data help communities:

Provide Assistance With Utilities

We want to know more about which fuel is used to heat homes in combination with the cost of those fuels and the characteristics

of the low-income households that need assistance with their utilities. This information helps communities enroll eligible

households in assistance programs like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and qualify for grants to fund

assistance. These data are also used to evaluate whether these programs beneﬁt eligible households.

Estimate Future Energy Demand

Information on the current users of certain heating systems and the kinds of systems used in new homes helps communities

predict future demand for fuels and the future costs of systems in use in a community. For example, the Department of Energy

uses these data to project demand over the next 30 years, assessing the energy needs of the U.S. economy in a domestic and

international context.

Measure Environmental Impacts

Communities with older heating systems may have lower air quality at times when they are in high use. Home heating fuel data

are used to develop an inventory of the national aggregate emissions of each greenhouse gas and to research and report on the
relationships among different development patterns (including housing and travel information) and public health and pollution

(Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act).

History of home heating fuel question

The home heating fuel question originated with the 1940 Census. It was transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the

decennial census long form.
