Understanding and Using
American Community
Survey Data: What
Congress Needs to Know

June 2020

Congress needs accurate, up-to-date
information to make good decisions

—from allocating federal program
funds to developing program

eligibility requirements, monitoring
compliance with federal laws, and
evaluating community needs.
Congressional staff also need timely
data to support communication

efforts, respond to constituent
inquiries, draft legislation, analyze
legislative proposals, and conduct
legislative research.

The U.S. Census Bureau’s American
Community Survey (ACS) provides

members of Congress the data they
need for decision-making. This guide
provides a brief overview of how
members of Congress use ACS data
for important legislative purposes.
