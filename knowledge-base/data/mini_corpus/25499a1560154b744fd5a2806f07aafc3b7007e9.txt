Improvements to the Race
Question

November 2021

Beginning in 2020, the Census Bureau implemented changes to the Race question based on extensive

research and outreach over the past decade. For more information please see the 2010 Census Race and
Hispanic Origin Alternative Questionnaire Experiment [/programs-surveys/decennial-

census/decade/2010/program-management/cpex/2010-cpex-211.html] and the 2015 National Content

Test [/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/planning-management/plan/final-

analysis/2015nct-race-ethnicity-analysis.html] .

Based on research and positive feedback from communities over the past decade, dedicated write-in

response areas and examples were added for the “White” racial category and the “Black or African

American” racial category.

Six example groups were provided for each of the "White," "Black or African American," and "American
Indian or Alaska Native" racial categories. These examples were selected as they represent the largest

population groups within each of the geographically diverse population groups of each category, as

defined by the 1997 OMB Standards.

The detailed Asian and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander checkboxes were reordered by
population size. 

The checkbox category “Guamanian or Chamorro” was changed to “Chamorro” based on research and

positive feedback from stakeholders.

The write-in instructions for the "Some Other Race" category were updated to better solicit detailed
reporting. The 2019 ACS form included the instruction to "Print race," the instruction used in the 2020

ACS was updated to "Print race or origin” to correspond with the overall question instruction to “Mark (X)

one or more boxes AND print origins.” 

Additionally, improvements were made to the way write-in responses to the race question were
processed and coded. The number of characters captured in each write-in area was increased from 30 to

200. Instead of prioritizing multiple responses into only two codes, up to six detailed codes for each

write-in area were coded.

Beginning in 2020, any data comparisons to prior race estimates should be made with caution, taking
into account the improvements we have made to the race question and the ways we code what people

tell us. However, please note that the Census Bureau does not recommend data users compare the 2020

1-year experimental ACS estimates with our standard ACS estimates.

The improvements made to the 2020 ACS race question design, processing, and coding are similar to
changes made in the 2020 Census, which are presented in the blog entitled, ‘Improvements to the 2020

Census Race and Hispanic Origin Question Designs, Data Processing, and Coding Procedures’
