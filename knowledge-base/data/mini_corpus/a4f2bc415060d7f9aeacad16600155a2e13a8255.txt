Guidance for Industry and
Occupation Data Users

We have created this page to help you figure out how to use these statistics. The guidance may explain

which data sources to use and how to make comparisons. Related sites may offer further information.

Because the industry and occupation classifications have changed overtime, crosswalks have been

developed to facilitate analysis of data across classification systems. The most recent code lists and

crosswalks are available for download.
