UNDERSTANDING AND USING AMERICAN  
COMMUNITY SURVEY DATA: 
WHAT ALL DATA USERS NEED TO KNOW 

Have you ever thought about how, or why, new roads, 
schools, after-school programs, or hospitals are placed 
in communities? What makes communities attractive 
to new businesses or tourists? Why there is no ATM or 
bike-share kiosk on a street corner? The answers often 
lie in the numbers—numbers that reflect what our com-
munities look like, how our communities have changed, 
and how those changes impact our daily lives. 

The U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 
(ACS) is designed to answer these types of questions 
and to meet the needs of policymakers, business lead-
ers, planners, and others nationwide who need good 
data to make informed decisions. The ACS provides a 

detailed portrait of the social, economic, housing, and 
demographic characteristics of America’s communities. 

This handbook provides an overview of the ACS to 
help data users understand the basics of the survey, 
how the data can be used, how to judge the accuracy 
of ACS estimates, and how to access ACS data on the 
Census Bureau’s Web site. It also includes some recent 
case studies that show how ACS data are being used 
to help address important policy and program issues. 
Links to additional ACS resources, including technical 
documentation for more advanced users, are included 
throughout the handbook.

1. UNDERSTANDING THE ACS: THE BASICS

What Is the ACS?

The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nation-
wide survey designed to provide communities with 
reliable and timely social, economic, housing, and 
demographic data every year. A separate annual sur-
vey, called the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS), 
collects similar data about the population and housing 
units in Puerto Rico. The Census Bureau uses data col-
lected in the ACS and the PRCS to provide estimates 
on a broad range of population, housing unit, and 
household characteristics for states, counties, cities, 
school districts, congressional districts, census tracts, 
block groups, and many other geographic areas. 

The ACS has an annual sample size of about 3.5 million 
addresses, with survey information collected nearly 
every day of the year. Data are pooled across a calen-
dar year to produce estimates for that year. As a result, 
ACS estimates reflect data that have been collected 
over a period of time rather than for a single point in 
time as in the decennial census, which is conducted 
every 10 years and provides population counts as of 
April 1 of the census year. 

ACS 1-year estimates are data that have been col-
lected over a 12-month period and are available for 
geographic areas with at least 65,000 people. Starting 
with the 2014 ACS, the Census Bureau is also produc-
ing “1-year Supplemental Estimates”—simplified ver-
sions of popular ACS tables—for geographic areas with 
at least 20,000 people. The Census Bureau combines 
5 consecutive years of ACS data to produce multiyear 
estimates for geographic areas with fewer than 65,000 

residents. These 5-year estimates represent data col-
lected over a period of 60 months.1  

Because the ACS is based on a sample, rather than all 
housing units and people, ACS estimates have a degree 
of uncertainty associated with them, called sampling 
error. In general, the larger the sample, the smaller the 
level of sampling error. To help users understand the 
impact of sampling error on data reliability, the Census 
Bureau provides a “margin of error” for each published 
ACS estimate. The margin of error, combined with the 
ACS estimate, give users a range of values within which 
the actual “real-world” value is likely to fall.

TIP: In general, data users should be careful in draw-
ing conclusions about small differences between two 
ACS estimates because they may not be statistically 
different.

The ACS provides vital information on a yearly basis 
about our nation and its people, helping local officials, 
community leaders, businesses, and the public plan 
and make decisions based on the changes taking place 
in their communities. Through the ACS, we know more 
about demographic trends, jobs and occupations, 
educational attainment, veterans, homeownership, and 
many other topics. Because data collection is ongoing, 
the ACS also provides essential, up-to-date informa-
tion about population and housing characteristics 
both before and after natural disasters like Superstorm 

1 The Census Bureau previously released 3-year estimates based on 
36 months of data collection. In 2015, the 3-year products were discon-
tinued. The 2011–2013 ACS 3-year estimates, released in 2014, are the 
last release of this product.

2007 to 2009, and public health emergencies like the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

TIP: The ACS was designed to provide estimates of 
the characteristics of the population, not to provide 
counts of the population in different geographic 
areas or population subgroups. For basic counts of 
the U.S. population by age, sex, race, and Hispanic 
origin, visit the Census Bureau’s Population and 
Housing Unit Estimates Web page.2

The content collected through the ACS can be 
grouped into four main types of characteristics: social, 
economic, housing, and demographic, as shown in 
Table 1.1. Various tables in the ACS have different 
“universes,” or base reference totals against which all 
other characteristics are compared. Some tables cover 
population characteristics, while others cover housing 
characteristics. Among the population tables, some 
cover the entire population (such as tables of the 
population by age), while some cover only a subset of 
the population (such as tables of employment status, 
which include data only for the population aged 16 and 
older). 

ACS content is designed to meet the needs of federal 
government agencies, and every question in the ACS is 
asked for a reason. For example, questions about how 
people get to work, when they leave, and the length 
of their commutes are used for planning improve-
ments to roads, highways, rail lines, and bus routes, 
and for planning emergency response routes. Because 
participation in the ACS is mandatory, the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) will only approve nec-
essary questions for inclusion in the ACS. The OMB’s 
responsibility under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
requires that new questions demonstrate the practical 
utility of the data and minimize “respondent burden.” 
Respondent burden can be defined in different ways, 
but is often related to the length of the interview or 
questionnaire, or the extent to which questions are 
viewed as being intrusive or too personal. 

Some people are reluctant to respond to the ACS 
because of concerns about the confidentiality of the 
data. However, strict confidentiality laws protect all 
ACS information that could be used to identify indi-
viduals or households under Title 13 of the U.S. Code.3 
This is true even for interagency communication: other

access individuals’ confidential information. 

Who Uses the ACS and Why?

The ACS puts up-to-date information about impor-
tant social issues at the fingertips of people who need 
it, including policymakers, researchers, businesses, 
nongovernmental organizations, journalists, teachers, 

students, and the public (see Box 1.1). Businesses use 
ACS data to better understand their current or poten-
tial customers. The federal government uses ACS infor-
mation to evaluate the need for federal programs and 
to run those programs effectively. Nongovernmental 
organizations use the ACS in a variety of ways to mon-
itor trends among important subgroups of the popu-
lation. Journalists use ACS data to report on new or 
emerging social trends or to put a piece of anecdotal 

Box 1.1. How Different Data-User Communities Use ACS Data

Federal agencies: ACS data help determine how 
more than $675 billion in federal funds are distrib-
uted to state and local areas each year.1 Federal 
agencies rely on the ACS to help them make opera-
tional decisions, including managing and evaluating 
programs, determining eligibility for programs, and 
benchmarking other statistics. For example, the 
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs uses ACS data 
on the characteristics of veterans to evaluate the 
need for educational, employment, and health care 
programs to assist those who have served in the 
military. The Special Supplemental Food Program 
for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) uses 
income data from the ACS to determine the poten-
tial demand for food assistance across states and 
counties. The Appalachian Regional Commission 
(ARC) uses ACS data to assess the status of com-
munities in the Appalachian Region on a host 
of social and economic measures, which in turn 
enables ARC to develop strategies to improve 
conditions in Appalachia. For more information 
about how federal agencies use ACS data, visit 
the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 
Handbook of Questions and Current Federal Uses.2 

Nongovernmental organizations: The Lucile 
Packard Foundation for Children’s Health uses ACS 
data to track annual changes in the well-being 
of children in California, including measures of 
child poverty, family structure, school enrollment, 
and employment status of parents. The Migration 
Policy Institute uses ACS data to present detailed, 
state-level information about the 42.4 million 
current U.S. residents who were born outside 
the United States. The State Health Access Data 
Assistance Center uses ACS data to monitor trends 
in health insurance coverage.

Journalists: Journalists regularly report ACS data 
to keep the public informed about emerging social, 
economic, housing, and demographic trends. 
For example, the New York Times used ACS data 
to map poverty rates and men’s employment in 
America.3 The Wall Street Journal reported on the 
cities with the fastest-growing median household 
incomes, based on ACS data.4 The Durango Herald 
(Durango, Colorado) used ACS 5-year data to show 
that many of Colorado’s newest residents are arriv-
ing from California and Texas.5

State and local governments: Information from 
the ACS is critical for state and local policymakers 
and planners who need up-to-date information 
about their communities to evaluate the need for 
new roads, hospitals, schools, senior centers, and 
other basic services. For example, the Council on 
Virginia’s Future, which advises the Governor and 
the Virginia General Assembly, relies on ACS data 
to monitor annual trends in travel time to work. 
New York City’s Department of City Planning used 
ACS data to identify the need for bilingual voting 
materials in certain New York neighborhoods.6

Businesses: Businesses use information from the 
ACS to understand their customers, make location 
or relocation decisions, and provide background 
information in loan applications. For example, ACS 
data are a key component of Zillow’s database of 
more than 110 million U.S. homes, helping home-
owners and potential buyers learn more about their

communities.7 Many data vendors, such as Esri and 
Nielsen, also incorporate ACS data either directly 
or indirectly into their commercial data products, 
which businesses use for market segmentation, site 
selection, and marketing strategies.8 

Researchers: Researchers both inside and out-
side of academia regularly use ACS data to test 
hypotheses, analyze data patterns across differ-
ent geographic areas, and to investigate trends 
over time. For example, researchers at the Pew 
Research Center use ACS data—often in combina-
tion with decennial census data—to monitor long-
term trends in U.S. education, income, employ-
ment, marriage, and family patterns. Staff at Wilder 
Research used ACS data to investigate the social 
determinants of health in Minnesota to help public

health professionals combat the spread of the

Disaster response and recovery: The  
American Red Cross uses ACS data to help identify 
vulnerable populations—before a disaster strikes—
and to monitor the impacts of a disaster during the 
response and recovery phases.10 In the aftermath 
of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, up-to-date, before-
and-after snapshots of community characteristics 
helped first and subsequent responders to bet-
ter target preparedness, response, and recovery 
efforts.11

evidence into a broader context. State and local gov-
ernments are using ACS information to keep track of 
year-to-year changes in their jurisdictions so they can 
better address the needs of their constituents.

One of the main strengths of the ACS is the ability to 
disaggregate the data by age group, race, Hispanic 
origin, sex, and other characteristics. For example, 
data users can compare the poverty status of children 
and older adults, college enrollment rates for men 
and women, or housing costs for African Americans 
and non-Hispanic Whites. No other resource provides 
such a wealth of social, economic, housing, and 
demographic information for the nation, states, and 
substate geographic areas.  

detailed questions about social, economic, and hous-
ing characteristics.

Data from the census long form provided a detailed 
snapshot, every 10 years, of America’s population 
and households. However, in today’s world, our com-
munities can change very quickly. Between decen-
nial censuses, local governments, organizations, and 
businesses need timely data to assess and plan for 
local needs. Costly mistakes can result when planners 
and policymakers do not have current data on which 
to base their decisions. That is one of the key reasons 
the Census Bureau moved to a new way of gathering 
data. Rather than taking a snapshot of communities 
once every 10 years, the ACS was designed to provide 
a dynamic and timely picture of the nation every year. 

History of the ACS 

Every 10 years since 1790, Congress has authorized 
funds to conduct a national census of the U.S. popula-
tion, as required by the U.S. Constitution. Censuses 
conducted between 1940 and 2000 consisted of a 
“short form,” which included basic questions about 
age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, household relationship, 
and owner/renter status, and a “long form” used for 
only a sample of households. The “long form” included 
not only the basic “short-form” questions, but also 

The ACS underwent years of extensive testing, includ-
ing demonstration surveys conducted in parallel with 
the 2000 Census to evaluate the reliability of survey 
results. The ACS achieved full, nationwide implemen-
tation in 2005 for the household population and was 
expanded to cover the full population (including group 
quarters—such as college dormitories) in 2006. In 
2010, the ACS replaced the census long form as the 
nation’s source of social and economic data for popu-
lation and housing characteristics.

4   Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data 
4   What All Data Users Need to Know

U.S. Census BureauOver time, questions have been added, revised, or 
removed from the survey, as shown in Table 1.1. For 
example, in 2008, three new questions on marital his-
tory, health insurance coverage, and veteran’s service-
connected disability were added, while the questions 
on disability were significantly revised to cause a break 
in series. The data from these new and revised ques-
tions collected in 2008 were first available in the ACS 
products released in 2009. A new question on bach-
elor’s field of degree was added in 2009—with data 
available in 2010—while in 2013, three new questions 
on computer ownership and Internet access were 
added, with data available in 2014. 

When a new question is added to the survey, 1-year 
estimates are available the following year, but it takes 
5 years to accumulate data for small geographic areas. 
While ACS 1-year estimates of health insurance cover-
age were first available in 2009, ACS 5-year estimates 
of coverage (for 2008–2012) were first available in 2013. 

In 2014, the Census Bureau conducted a compre-
hensive assessment of the ACS program, including a 
review of each ACS question. This ACS Content Review 
sought to understand which federal programs use the 
information collected by each question and assess how 
the Census Bureau might reduce respondent burden.4 
Based on this assessment, the questions on the pres-
ence of a flush toilet and whether there is a business or 
medical office on the property were removed from the 
ACS, beginning with the 2016 survey.

The sample size of the ACS and the ways data are col-
lected have also changed over time, as described in 
more detail in the next section. 

How Are ACS Data Collected?

From 2005 through 2012, the ACS collected data using 
three sequential methods, or “modes”: paper question-
naires through the mail, phone interviews, and per-
sonal visits with a Census Bureau interviewer. Starting 
in 2013, the Census Bureau added a fourth mode—an 
Internet response option—that simplified data collec-
tion and reduced survey costs. Starting in late 2017, 
based on declining response rates and increasing 
costs, the Census Bureau discontinued using phone 
interviews to follow up with nonrespondents. The 
annual sample size of the ACS has also increased over 
time, from 2.9 million addresses in 2005 to more than 
3.5 million addresses in 2015. This increased sample 
size has improved the precision of the ACS estimates.

Review, <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/operations-and 
-administration/2014-content-review.html>. 

Over a 5-year period, the Census Bureau samples 
approximately 1-in-9 households nationwide, but the 
sampling rate is higher in areas with small populations 
and low predicted response rates. 

Of the 3.5 million addresses selected for ACS inter-
views in 2018, about 2.1 million resulted in final inter-
views. The number of final interviews is smaller than 
the number of initial addresses selected because the 
Census Bureau conducts in-person interviews with 
only a subset of those who do not respond by Internet, 
mail, or phone. Addresses are also excluded if they are 
determined to be invalid or commercial. In 2018, the 
national response rate for the ACS was 92.0 percent.5 
For more information about ACS sample size and 
response rates, visit the Census Bureau’s Web page on 
Sample Size and Data Quality.6

The annual ACS sample is smaller than that of the 
2000 Census long-form sample, which included about 
18 million housing units. As a result, the ACS needs 
to combine population or housing data from multiple 
years to produce reliable numbers for small coun-
ties, neighborhoods, and other local areas. To provide 
information for communities each year, the ACS cur-
rently provides 1-year estimates for geographic areas 
with at least 65,000 people and 5-year estimates for 
smaller geographic areas down to the census tract 
and block-group level. Starting with the 2014 ACS, the 
Census Bureau is also producing 1-year Supplemental 
Estimates—simplified versions of popular ACS tables 
for geographic areas with populations of 20,000 or 
more.

One important fact to remember about the ACS is that 
the request to complete the survey is not mailed to 
specific people, but rather to specific addresses. The 
Census Bureau selects a random sample of addresses 
to be included in the ACS. Each address has about a 
1-in-40 chance of being selected in a given year, and 
no address should be selected more than once every 5 
years. Each month, the Census Bureau sends an initial 
mail package to approximately 295,000 addresses 
across the United States. This is a small number of 
housing units considering there are more than 140 mil-
lion addresses in the United States.

Until 2015, the Census Bureau sent all selected 
addresses an advance notification letter inform-
ing people living at that address that they had been

U.S. Census Bureauselected to participate in the ACS. Shortly thereafter 
(for most U.S. addresses), instructions for complet-
ing the survey by Internet were mailed. Beginning 
in August 2015, the Census Bureau eliminated the 
advance notification letter and instead included 
instructions in the initial mail package for complet-
ing the survey by Internet or over the phone through 
a toll-free Telephone Questionnaire Assistance (TQA) 
line. If households do not respond by Internet or TQA, 
then a paper questionnaire is mailed to the address. 
In Puerto Rico and some hard-to-reach areas, only a 
paper questionnaire is mailed. 

Until 2017, if no response was received by Internet, 
TQA, or mail within a month following the initial mail-
ing, the Census Bureau followed up with a telephone 
interview when a telephone number was available. 
However, beginning in October 2017, the Census 
Bureau discontinued the telephone Nonresponse 
Followup operation because of declining response 
rates and increasing costs. Respondent data are still 
collected via telephone through the TQA operation.

If the Census Bureau is unable to get a response 
by Internet, mail, or TQA, then the address may be 
selected for an in-person interview. Because of the 
high cost per completed interview, the Census Bureau 
samples about one in three nonrespondent housing 
units for personal visit interviews. The proportion of 
nonresponding households selected for in-person 
interviews is higher in areas with lower predicted 
response rates. A sample of people living in group 
quarters facilities—such as college dorms, skilled nurs-
ing facilities, or correctional facilities—is also inter-
viewed in person to ensure coverage of people who 
are not living in housing units. 

While the basic method for selecting the ACS sample 
is the same across the country, the Census Bureau 
applies different sampling rates in some cases to 
improve the reliability of estimates. For example, the 
ACS samples up to 15 percent of housing units in less 
populated areas, while sampling rates in more popu-
lated areas are often much lower. For more information 
about ACS methods, visit the Census Bureau’s Design 
and Methodology Report Web page.7

Population Controls

As with most household surveys, the ACS data are 
controlled so that the numbers of housing units and 
people in certain categories agree with the Census 
Bureau’s official estimates. The ACS uses a weighting 
method to ensure that ACS estimates are consistent 
with official Census Bureau population estimates by 
age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin—as well as estimates 

of total housing units. ACS estimates are controlled 
to official population and housing units at the county 
level. ACS single-year estimates are controlled to 
population and total housing unit estimates as of July 
1 of the survey year, while ACS 5-year estimates are 
controlled to the average of the July 1 population and 
housing unit estimates over the 5-year period.

Starting with the 2009 survey, ACS estimates of the 
total population of incorporated places (self-governing 
cities, towns, or villages) and minor civil divisions (such 
as county precincts) are also adjusted so that they are 
consistent with official population estimates. 

TIP: ACS data for small statistical areas (such as 
census tracts) have no control totals, which may lead 
to errors in the population and housing unit esti-
mates. In such cases, data users are encouraged to 
rely more upon noncount statistics, such as percent 
distributions or averages.

For more information about ACS methods, visit the 
Census Bureau’s Design and Methodology Report Web 
page.8

When Are ACS Data Released?

ACS data are very timely because they are released 
in the year immediately following the year in which 
they are collected (see Table 1.2). Beginning with data 
collected in 2005, 1-year estimates have been pub-
lished for areas with populations of 65,000 or more, 
including all states, the District of Columbia, and many 
large counties and cities. In 2010, the Census Bureau 
released the first ACS 5-year estimates for the nation, 
states, cities, counties, and other small geographic 
areas. These 5-year estimates have been updated 
annually by removing the earliest year and replacing it 
with the latest one, thus providing an unprecedented 
ability to annually monitor social and economic trends 
in local communities.

The Census Bureau also produced ACS 3-year esti-
mates, starting in 2008, but that series was discontin-
ued in 2015. However, every community in the nation 
will continue to receive a detailed statistical portrait 
of its social, economic, housing, and demographic 
characteristics through ACS 1-year and 5-year data 
products. 

In July 2016, the Census Bureau released a series of 
Supplemental Estimates, consisting of new 1-year 
estimates for geographic areas with populations of 
20,000 or more. These tables provide 1-year estimates 
for many geographic areas that were previously only 
available through the 3-year or 5-year data products.

U.S. Census Bureau2. GEOGRAPHIC AREAS COVERED IN THE ACS

Data from the American Community Survey (ACS) are 
tabulated for a variety of different geographic areas 
ranging in size from broad geographic regions  
(Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) to states, cities, 
towns, census tracts, and block groups (see Box 2.1). 
Table 2.1 shows the type and number of geographic 
areas included in the ACS 1-year and 5-year products 
for 2018. For example, in 2018, ACS 1-year data were 
available for 838 counties (26 percent of all counties), 

while the remaining 2,382 counties (74 percent of all 
counties) received 5-year estimates. Note that the 
information in this table is based on current geo-
graphic boundaries and is expected to change over 
time. The ACS uses boundaries as of January 1 of the 
last year of the estimate period. For example, the 
2014–2018 ACS 5-year estimates use boundaries as of 
January 1, 2018, as reported to the U.S. Census Bureau.  

Box 2.1. Explaining Census Bureau Geography

For reporting purposes, the nation is subdivided 
into two main types of geographic areas, legal and 
statistical. Legal areas are defined specifically by 
law, and include state, local, and tribal government 
units, as well as some specially defined administra-
tive areas like congressional districts. Many, but 
not all, are represented by elected officials. An 
example of a legal area is New York State.

Statistical areas are defined directly by the Census 
Bureau and state, regional, or local authorities, and 
include census tracts and urban areas. The primary 

purpose of statistical areas is to tabulate and 
present census data. An example of a statistical 
area is the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH 
Metropolitan Statistical Area. 

Geographic areas are organized in a geographic 
hierarchy (see Figure 2.1). Larger units, such as 
states, include smaller units, such as counties and 
census tracts. This structure is derived from the 
legal, administrative, or areal relationships of the 
entities.

What All Data Users Need to Know  9

U.S. Census BureauKey Geographic Areas in the ACS

In Figures 2.2 through 2.5, sample images for four 
different states—Utah, Kentucky, Iowa, and Vermont—
show data users some of the key geographic areas 
available through the ACS: congressional districts, 
Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs), counties, and 
census tracts.

Congressional districts are redrawn after each census for 
the purpose of electing the members of the U.S. House 
of Representatives. Each of Utah’s four congressional 
districts (shown in Figure 2.2) includes approximately 
750,000 people. ACS data on congressional districts can 
be used to compare the home districts of the 435 House 
members and how they have changed over time. 

The Census Bureau also divides each state into a series 
of PUMAs, each of which has a minimum population 
of 100,000. PUMAs are constructed based on county 
and neighborhood boundaries and do not cross state 
lines. Typically, counties with large populations are 
subdivided into multiple PUMAs, while PUMAs in more 

rural areas are made up of groups of adjacent counties. 
PUMAs are especially useful for rural areas because, 
unlike counties, they all meet the 65,000-population 
threshold that is needed to produce ACS 1-year esti-
mates. Kentucky’s PUMAs are shown below in Figure 
2.3. 

Counties are also important because they are the 
primary legal subdivision within each state. ACS 1-year 
estimates are currently available for 10 of Iowa’s 99 
counties—those with populations of 65,000 or more in 
2018 (see Figure 2.4). Iowa has 35 counties with popu-
lations of at least 20,000 people that receive 1-year 
Supplemental Estimates. The 64 counties in Iowa 
with fewer than 20,000 people only receive 5-year 
estimates.10

10 There are two counties that did not meet the 20,000 popula-
tion threshold in 2018 that received 1-year Supplemental Estimates 
(Buena Vista and Fayette counties). Estimates for these counties were 
published because the areas’ total populations fell within 5 percent of 
20,000, and data for the areas were published for the previous year. 
This rule is also applied to the 65,000-population threshold for ACS 
1-year estimates.

Census tracts are small geographic areas—with an 
average of about 4,000 people each—that are com-
monly used to present information for small towns, 
rural areas, and neighborhoods. For example, in 
Vermont, there are currently 184 census tracts with 
data available through the ACS 5-year data products 
(see Figure 2.5). 

There are also more than 300 ACS data tables 
available for block groups—subdivisions of census  
 tracts—that include between 600 and 3,000 peo-
ple each. In the ACS, block groups are the lowest 

(smallest) level of geography published. Block 
group data are only available in the ACS 5-year data 
products.

12   What All Data Users Need to Know

U.S. Census Bureau3. UNDERSTANDING AND USING ACS SINGLE-
YEAR AND MULTIYEAR ESTIMATES

Each year, the U.S. Census Bureau publishes American 
Community Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates for geo-
graphic areas with populations of 65,000 or more. 
The 65,000-population threshold ensures that 1-year 
data are available for all regions, divisions, states, 
the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, congressio-
nal districts, Public Use Microdata Areas, and many 
large counties and county equivalents, metropolitan 
and micropolitan areas, cities, school districts, and 
American Indian areas.11 The 1-year Supplemental 
Estimates, simplified versions of popular ACS 
tables, are also available for geographic areas with 
at least 20,000 people. These annual data provide 
policymakers, planners, business leaders, and others 
with a critical source of up-to-date information to plan 
for services such as transportation, medical care, hous-
ing, and schools.

For geographic areas with smaller populations, the 
ACS samples too few housing units to provide reliable 
single-year estimates. For these areas, several years 
of data are pooled together to create more precise 
multiyear estimates. Since 2010, the ACS has published 
5-year data (beginning with 2005–2009 estimates) 
for all geographic areas down to the census tract and 
block group levels.12 

This means that there are two sets of numbers—both 
1-year estimates and 5-year estimates—available for 
geographic areas with at least 65,000 people, such 
as the state of Virginia. Less populous areas, such as 
Bath County in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley, receive 
only 5-year estimates. As shown in Table 2.1 in the sec-
tion on “Geographic Areas Covered in the ACS,” the 
vast majority of geographic areas receive only 5-year 
estimates.  

Understanding Period Estimates

Single-year and multiyear estimates from the ACS are 
all “period” estimates derived from a sample collected 
over a period of time, as opposed to “point-in-time” 
estimates such as those from past decennial censuses. 
For example, the 2000 Census “long form” sampled 
the resident U.S. population as of April 1, 2000. 

11 Public Use Microdata Areas, or PUMAs, are collections of coun-
ties—or tracts within counties—with approximately 100,000 people 
each. PUMAs do not cross state lines.

12 For several years, the Census Bureau produced both ACS 3-year 

estimates (for areas with populations of 20,000 or more) and ACS 
5-year estimates (for all geographic areas). Starting with the 2014 data 
release, the 3-year products were discontinued, but 5-year estimates 
are still published each year.

While an ACS 1-year estimate includes information col-
lected over a 12-month period, an ACS 5-year estimate 
includes data collected over a 60-month period. 

In the case of ACS 1-year estimates, the period is the 
calendar year (e.g., the 2018 ACS covers the period 
from January 2018 through December 2018). In the 
case of ACS multiyear estimates, the period is 5 calen-
dar years (e.g., the 2014–2018 ACS estimates cover the 
period from January 2014 through December 2018). 
Therefore, ACS estimates based on data collected from 
2014–2018 should not be labeled “2016,” even though 
that is the midpoint of the 5-year period.

Multiyear estimates should be labeled to indicate 
clearly the full period of time (e.g., “The child pov-
erty rate in 2014–2018 was X percent.”). They do not 
describe any specific day, month, or year within that 
time period.

Multiyear estimates require some considerations that 
single-year estimates do not. For example, multiyear 
estimates released in consecutive years consist mostly 
of overlapping years and shared data. 

TIP: As shown in Figure 3.1, consecutive 5-year esti-
mates contain 4 years of overlapping coverage (for 
example, the 2013–2017 ACS 5-year estimates share 
sample data from 2014 through 2017 with the 2014–
2018 ACS 5-year estimates). Because of this overlap, 
users should use extreme caution in making compari-
sons with consecutive years of multiyear estimates.

The primary advantage of using multiyear estimates 
is the increased statistical reliability of the data com-
pared with that of single-year estimates, particularly 
for small geographic areas and small population 
subgroups. Figure 3.2 shows the improved precision 
of an ACS 5-year estimate, compared with a 1-year 
estimate, for child poverty statistics in Bay County, 
Michigan—a county with about 100,000 residents in 
2018. The lines above and below the point estimates 
represent the confidence intervals, or ranges of uncer-
tainty, around each estimate. The confidence interval 
for the 1-year child poverty estimate ranges from 23.5 
percent to 36.9 percent (13 percentage points) while 
the interval for the 5-year estimate is narrower, rang-
ing from 22.7 percent to 27.7 percent (5 percentage 
points). (Refer to the section on “Understanding Error 
and Determining Statistical Significance” for a detailed 
explanation of uncertainty in ACS data.)

U.S. Census BureauDeciding Which ACS Estimate to Use

For data users interested in obtaining detailed ACS 
data for small geographic areas (areas with fewer than 
65,000 residents), ACS 5-year estimates are the only 
option.13 However, data users interested in estimates 
for areas with populations of 65,000 or more have 
a choice between the 1-year and 5-year data series. 
Which data should be used?

The 1-year estimates for an area reflect the most cur-
rent data but they have larger margins of error than 
the 5-year estimates because they are based on a 
smaller sample. The 5-year estimates for an area have 
larger samples and smaller margins of error than 
the 1-year estimates. However, they are less current 
because the larger samples include data that were 
collected in earlier years. The main advantage of using 
multiyear estimates is the increased statistical reliabil-
ity for smaller geographic areas and small population 
groups.

One-year estimates are particularly useful for geo-
graphic areas with rapidly changing characteristics 
because they are based on the most current data—
data from the past year. For example, ACS 1-year data 
were used to compare poverty rates before, during, 

13 In July 2016, the Census Bureau released a series of Supplemental 

Estimates, consisting of new 1-year estimates for geographic areas 
with populations of 20,000 or more. These tables provide 1-year esti-
mates for many geographic areas that were previously only available 
through the 3-year or 5-year data products.

and after the 2007–2009 recession. In contrast, 5-year 
estimates provide less current information because 
they are based on both data from the previous year 
and data that are 2 to 5 years old. For many areas 
undergoing minimal change, using the “less current” 
multiyear estimates may not have a substantial influ-
ence on the estimates. However, in areas experiencing 
major changes over a given time period, the multiyear 
estimates may be quite different from the single-year 
estimates for any of the individual years. The single-
year and multiyear estimates will not be the same 
because they are based on data from two different 
time periods. This will be true even if the ACS single 
year is the midyear of the ACS multiyear period (e.g., 
2016 single year, 2014–2018 multiyear). 

For example, suppose a transportation planner in 
Austin, Texas, is interested in measuring recent trends 
in tele commuting. Comparing data by release year 
shows that the 5-year estimates are lagging behind the 
1-year estimates (see Figure 3.3). For example, while 
the 1-year estimates show a recent decline in the share 
of people working from home, the 5-year estimates 
show a fairly steady increase over time. 

TIP: In general, ACS 1-year data are more likely to 
show year-to-year fluctuations, while consecutive 
5-year estimates are more likely to show a smooth 
trend, because 4 of the 5 years in the series overlap 
from one year to the next.

ACS 3-year estimates will remain available to data users, but no new 3-year estimates will be produced. Every community in the nation will 
continue to receive a detailed statistical portrait of its social, economic, housing, and demographic characteristics through 1-year and 5-year  
ACS products.

TIP: Data users may think that multiyear estimates 
are only appropriate when working with data for 
small areas, but this is not the case. Large geographic 
areas also benefit from the larger sample used for 
5-year estimates, resulting in more precise estimates 
of population and housing characteristics, especially 
for subpopulations within those areas. 

In addition, ACS 5-year estimates are not subject 
to the same data suppression rules that the Census 
Bureau applies to 1-year estimates. The Census Bureau 
restricts some 1-year data tables from publication 
because the estimates are not reliable. For more infor-
mation, visit the Census Bureau’s Web page on Data 
Suppression.14

14 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, Data  
Suppression, <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical 
-documentation/data-suppression.html>.

Some users may prefer to use 1-year estimates, despite 
their reduced reliability, as building blocks to produce 
estimates for meaningful higher levels of geography. 
For example, data for neighboring counties could be 
combined to produce estimates for a metropolitan or 
regional planning area. These aggregations will simi-
larly benefit from the increased sample sizes, through 
improved precision. 

There are no hard-and-fast rules for choosing between 
1-year and 5-year data, but the margins of error 
provided with ACS data can help data users decide 
on the tradeoff between currency and reliability. 
Table 3.1 shows the different features of ACS 1-year, 
1-year Supplemental, 3-year, and 5-year estimates 
that data users can consider in choosing which esti-
mates to use. Data users can also refer to the section 
on “Understanding Error and Determining Statistical 
Significance” for guidance on assessing the reliability 
of ACS estimates.

U.S. Census Bureau4. MAKING COMPARISONS WITH ACS DATA

One of the main benefits of the American Community 
Survey (ACS) is the ability to make comparisons—over 
time, across different geographic areas, and across dif-
ferent population subgroups. For example, data users 
may be interested in:

•  Comparing the proportion of people without 

health insurance in two counties.

•  Comparing the child poverty rate with the poverty 

rate for the working-age population.

•  Comparing the proportion of people who are 

foreign-born in a city in 2018 with the correspond-
ing share in 2017.

•  Comparing the proportion of people with college 

degrees from 2000 to 2018 in a state, based on 
data from the ACS and the 2000 Census.

When making comparisons with ACS data, note that 
differences in survey design, questionnaire content and 
design, sample size, or geography may affect compa-
rability of estimates. 

TIP: ACS data users interested in making compari-
sons also need to pay attention to sampling error 
because differences between estimates may, or may 
not, be statistically significant. 

This section describes some of the key considerations 
for data users making comparisons with ACS data. 
The U.S. Census Bureau also provides extensive guid-
ance on comparing ACS data on their Web site.15 The 
section on “Understanding Error and Determining 
Statistical Significance” includes guidance on how to 
calculate and interpret the statistical significance of 
differences between estimates.

The Census Bureau created a statistical testing tool to 
help data users test whether ACS estimates are statisti-
cally different from one another.16 

Comparing ACS Data Across 
Geographic Areas

One of the challenges for data users is deciding how 
to compare geographic areas with different popula-
tion sizes. Estimates for areas with fewer than 20,000 
people are produced only in the form of 5-year esti-
mates. However, for larger areas with at least 65,000 
people (or 20,000 people in the case of the 1-year 
Supplemental Estimates) both 1-year and 5-year data

/guidance/statistical-testing-tool.html>.

are available, so data users need to choose which esti-
mates to use.17

TIP: When comparing ACS estimates across differ-
ent geographic areas or population subgroups, data 
users should avoid comparing ACS single-year esti-
mates with ACS multiyear estimates. That is, 1-year 
estimates should only be compared with other 1-year 
estimates, and 5-year estimates should only be com-
pared with other 5-year estimates. 

For example, suppose a policymaker wanted to com-
pare veterans’ characteristics in Athens, Texas—a small 
city southeast of Dallas—with veterans in Houston. 
Although the ACS publishes annual estimates on vet-
erans for Houston, only 5-year estimates are available 
for Athens. Thus, the policymaker should compare ACS 
5-year estimates for Athens with ACS 5-year estimates 
for Houston, even though more recent, single-year 
estimates are available for Houston. 

TIP: Another option for presenting ACS data for less 
populated areas is to show single-year estimates for 
large counties in Texas and then combine the remain-
ing counties into a state “residual” by subtracting 
the available single-year data from the state total. 
Alternatively, data users could present ACS estimates 
for Public Use Microdata Areas, since they meet the 
65,000-population threshold required for single-
year estimates and are often used as a substitute for 
county-level data.18

Comparing ACS Data Over Time

TIP: Data users are encouraged to compare ACS data 
over time based on nonoverlapping estimates. 

When using ACS 1-year data, these comparisons are 
generally straightforward. Using multiyear estimates 
to look at trends for small populations can be chal-
lenging because they rely on pooled data for 5 years. 
For example, comparisons of 5-year estimates from 
2013 to 2017 and 2014 to 2018 are unlikely to show 
much difference because four of the years overlap; 
both sets of estimates include the same data collected 
from 2014 through 2017.19 The Census Bureau suggests 
comparing 5-year estimates that do not overlap—for 

17 In July 2016, the Census Bureau also released a series of 1-year 
Supplemental Estimates—simplified versions of popular ACS tables 
available for geographic areas with at least 20,000 people. 

18 Although Public Use Microdata Areas typically follow county 

boundaries, this is not always the case, particularly in some New 
England states. 

19 While the interpretation of this difference is difficult, these com-
parisons can be made with caution. Users who are interested in com-
paring overlapping multiyear period estimates should refer to the sec-
tion on “Understanding Error and Determining Statistical Significance” 
for more information.

Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data  17 
What All Data Users Need to Know  17

U.S. Census Bureau 
example, comparing 2009–2013 ACS 5-year estimates 
with 2014–2018 ACS 5-year estimates. When new 
ACS 5-year data are released, it will be possible to 
update this trend, based on data from 2010–2014 and 
2015–2019. 

TIP: Changes to ACS questions over time may make it 
difficult to measure trends. For example, the Census 
Bureau made substantial changes to the 2008 ACS 
questions on labor force participation and number of 
weeks worked. As a result, the Census Bureau recom-
mends using caution when comparing 2008 and later 
labor force data with 2007 and earlier estimates.

TIP: Data users are also encouraged to pay attention 
to sampling error associated with ACS data when 
looking at trends over time. For example, 1-year esti-
mates for a relatively small population subgroup may 
vary widely from year to year because of sampling 
variation, obscuring an underlying trend. In this case, 
multiyear estimates may be useful for assessing an 
underlying, long-term trend.

However, because multiyear estimates have an inher-
ent smoothing effect on trends—because of overlap-
ping estimates from year to year—they will tend to 
mask rapidly developing changes. 

Changes in Geography

ACS data generally reflect the geographic boundaries 
as of the year the data are collected. While geographic 
boundary changes are somewhat infrequent, they do 
occur, and those changes can affect a data user’s abil-
ity to make comparisons over time. For example, con-
gressional districts are redrawn every 10 years imme-
diately following the decennial census. Congressional 
district data from the 2012 ACS and later years reflect 
the new boundaries that were drawn after the 2010 
Census, while ACS data for earlier years reflect the 
2000 Census boundaries. Given the major changes to 
district boundaries after each census, a comparison of 
congressional district data between 2011 and 2012 is 
not feasible.

ACS data are also regularly updated to reflect local 
changes in geographic boundaries. For example, the 
city of Jurupa Valley, California, incorporated in July 
2011. Data for this city was first published in 2012, and 
has been updated each subsequent year, but data 
are not available for Jurupa Valley for 2011 and earlier 
years. The Census Bureau does not revise ACS data 
for previous years to reflect changes in geographic 
boundaries. For more information, visit the Census 
Bureau’s Web page on Geography & ACS.20

20 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS),  

Geography & ACS, <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs 
/geography-acs.html>.

Changes in Population Controls

The ACS uses a weighting methodology to ensure 
that ACS estimates are consistent with official Census 
Bureau population estimates by age, sex, race, and 
Hispanic origin. With each annual release of population 
estimates, the Population Estimates Program revises 
and updates the entire time series of estimates from 
the previous decennial census to the current year. 
However, ACS estimates for prior years are not revised 
or reweighted based on updated population estimates. 

The change in the population estimates from 2009 to 
2010 was particularly significant. The 2010 ACS 1-year 
data and 2006–2010 ACS 5-year data were controlled 
to population estimates that reflected the results of 
the 2010 Census. However, the 1-year and 5-year data 
for 2009 and earlier years used population estimates 
that were based on the 2000 Census.  

TIP: Because the 2009 ACS and 2010 ACS 1-year 
estimates use controls that are based on different 
decennial census base years, data users need to 
use caution when making comparisons across these 
years. Specifically, estimates of the number of people 
in a given geographic area or population subgroup 
are not strictly comparable between these two years. 
However, rates and percentages—as well as monetary 
data, such as median income values—are generally 
comparable between the two periods.

Comparisons With Data From the  
2000 Census, the 2010 Census, and  
the 2020 Census

The ACS was modeled after the long form of the 
decennial census, and data users interested in 
long-term trends can, in many cases, make valid 
comparisons between ACS and the 2000 Census (and 
earlier decennial census) estimates. Census Bureau 
subject matter specialists have reviewed the factors 
that could affect differences between ACS and the 
2000 Census estimates and they have determined 
that ACS estimates are similar to those obtained from 
past decennial census sample data for most areas and 
characteristics. 

However, differences in residence rules, universes 
(base reference totals against which all other char-
acteristics are compared), and reference periods 
between the two surveys should be considered when 
making these comparisons. For example, the ACS 
data are collected throughout the calendar year while 
the 2000 Census long form sampled the population 
as of April 1, 2000. Given the differences in the refer-
ence period, the two surveys may yield very different 
estimates for communities with large seasonal popula-
tions or those undergoing rapid change. The section 

18   Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data 
18   What All Data Users Need to Know

U.S. Census Bureauon “Differences Between the ACS and the Decennial 
Census” provides more information about these 
differences.

The 2010 Census and 2020 Census were short-form 
only censuses so they do not include all of the detailed 
social, economic, and housing data available from 
previous censuses. However, data users can make 
valid comparisons between ACS estimates and basic 
characteristics from these censuses, including age, 
sex, race, Hispanic origin, household relationship, and 
homeowner status. For basic counts of the U.S. popu-
lation by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin between 
censuses, data users are encouraged to use the Census 
Bureau’s official population estimates, available on 
the Census Bureau’s Population and Housing Unit 
Estimates Web site.21 

Using Monetary Data

TIP: Data users also need to use caution in looking 
at trends involving income or other measures that 
are adjusted for inflation, such as rental costs, home 
values, and utility costs. 

For example, to compare published monetary data for 
the most recent year with data from the 2010 ACS, 
data users need to adjust the 2010 data for inflation, 
based on a national-level consumer price index. 

ACS multiyear estimates with dollar values are adjusted 
for inflation to the final year of the period. For example, 
the 2014–2018 ACS 5-year estimates are tabulated 
using dollars adjusted to 2018. 

21 U.S. Census Bureau, Population and Housing Unit Estimates, 

<www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html>.

Note that inflation adjustment does not adjust for dif-
ferences in costs of living across different geographic 
areas. The section on “Using Dollar-Denominated Data” 
provides more information on the adjustment of ACS 
single-year and multiyear estimates for inflation.

U.S. Census BureauAdvanced Tools for Accessing ACS Data

In addition to the products described above, the Census Bureau makes ACS data available in a variety of formats 
for data users interested in using more advanced statistical, geographic, database, or programming applications.

Summary File: The ACS Summary File is a comma-delimited text file that contains all of the Detailed Tables for 
the ACS data releases.40 The file is stored with only the data from the tables and without such  
information as the table title, description of the rows, or geographic identifiers. That information is located in 
other files that the user must merge with the data file to reproduce full tables. (Users can do so through such 
statistical packages as SAS, SPSS, or STATA.)  

 Geographic areas covered: All areas down to the block group level. The Summary File is currently the only  
 source for accessing block group data from the 2005–2009 through 2008–2012 ACS 5-year data, since those  
 estimates are not available through data.census.gov. 

Why this tool may be right for you

Why you may want to consider another tool

Along with the Detailed Tables, the Summary File 
is the best source for the most comprehensive ACS 
tables.

You are able to use data.census.gov to access your table(s) of 
interest (particularly the Detailed Tables).

The Summary File covers all subjects in the ACS.

The Summary File may contain more detail than needed for your 
topic.

Statistics are available for areas down to the block 
group level.

The tool does not provide percentages.

You are a skilled programmer with access to statistical 
software to conduct analysis (e.g., SAS, SPSS, STATA).

Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS): Data users with expertise in using statistical packages may also be 
interested in the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files, which contain a sample of individual records of 
people and households that responded to the survey (stripped of all identifying information).41 The PUMS files 
permit analysis of specific population groups and custom variables that are not available through the pretabu-
lated tables in data.census.gov. For example, PUMS data users can look at the proportion of children aged 5 to 
11 living in low-income working families or the number of scientists and engineers earning more than $75,000. 
Data users can also combine multiple years of PUMS data to produce estimates for relatively small population 
subgroups (e.g., American Indian physicians).

 Geographic areas covered: Nation, states, and Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). PUMAs are special  
 nonoverlapping areas that partition each state into contiguous geographic units containing no fewer than  
 100,000 people each.

Case Study #1: New Orleans Smoke Alarm Outreach Program

Skill Level: Intermediate 
Subject: Age, Income, Poverty, Year Structure Built, Year Householder Moved Into Unit 
Type of Analysis: Analyses of trends/patterns within a community 
Tools Used: data.census.gov, statistical software, and mapping software 
Author: Oliver Wise, Director of the Office of Performance and Accountability, City of New Orleans

As a component of its fire prevention effort, the New Orleans Fire Department (NOFD) offers free smoke alarm 
installation to all city residents. Initially the program was fairly passive—requiring individuals to contact the fire 
department to request a smoke alarm, but local leaders wondered if the program was as effective as it could be.

To answer that question, and to help guide the city’s efforts in reducing fire fatalities, the Office of Performance 
and Accountability teamed up with the NOFD to pilot a more targeted approach to smoke alarm installation. The 
team developed a model to identify neighborhoods most at risk for fire fatalities. That model then helped NOFD 
prioritize a door-to-door effort to install free smoke alarms in homes across New Orleans. 

This analysis combined data from multiple sources, but would not have been possible without the American  
Community Survey (ACS). 

The first step was to estimate the likelihood that homes in a neighborhood were missing smoke alarms. From the 
American Housing Survey (AHS), the research team identified three key factors associated with lack of a smoke 
alarm: the age of the structure, the length of time the householder has lived in the structure, and the household’s 
ratio of income to the poverty level. However, AHS data are only available for relatively large areas. (Parishes, 
the equivalent of counties in other states, are the smallest reported geographies in Louisiana.) NOFD needed 
a smaller spatial scale for targeted outreach. The ACS filled that local data requirement because ACS data are 
available at a small neighborhood scale. For this project, we used block group data from the 2009–2013 ACS 
5-year estimates to identify neighborhoods most at risk for lack of smoke alarms.

To produce the block-group-level analysis of smoke alarm risk, we downloaded three ACS tables from  
data.census.gov: B25034 (Year Structure Built), C17002 (Ratio of Income to Poverty Level in the Past 12 Months), 
and B25038 (Tenure by Year Householder Moved Into Unit).

•  First, we went to the data.census.gov site: <https://data.census.gov>. 

•  To access the estimates from data.census.gov, we chose the “Advanced Search” option (see Figure 6.1).

Clicking on the downloaded zip file opened a folder containing three files. We selected the file with the prefix 
“ACSDT5Y2013.B25034_data_with_overlays” to open the data table in a spreadsheet. We repeated this process 
in data.census.gov for the two other tables (C17002 and B25038). 

The research team then used a statistical program to aggregate the data from each table into relevant risk 
categories. We used data from Table C17002 to calculate the percentage of households in each block group 
with income below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, data from Table B25034 to identify the percentage 
of housing structures built before 1949, and data from Table B25038 to identify the percentage of household-
ers who moved into their home before 2000. We then used these three indicators to assign a risk score to each 
block group.

It is important to note that some block groups are sparsely populated, and some have no population at all. For 
example, Lake Pontchartrain is probably not a relevant block group for smoke alarm outreach. To account for 
this, we removed large, sparsely populated (or completely unpopulated) block groups from the analysis.

The second step of the analysis was to estimate fire fatality risk. Since young children and older adults are most 
at risk of death in a fire, we used 2010 Census data to identify block groups with high proportions of people 
under the age of 5 or age 65 or older. In addition, we added fire frequency data from NOFD records for March 
2009 to March 2015. Using these three pieces of information, we compiled a fire fatality risk map.

Overlaying the smoke alarm risk map—based on ACS data—with the fire fatality risk map, we were able to high-
light neighborhoods where fire mortality risk was high and where homes were unlikely to have smoke alarms. 
NOFD used that map to begin a door-to-door campaign in high-risk neighborhoods to install smoke alarms. We 
estimated that the program was twice as effective as random assignment would have been for contacting house-
holds in need of smoke alarms.

Shortly after the program began, a fire occurred in one of the homes in which a smoke alarm had been installed 
based on the targeted installation outreach. Eleven people survived that fire because they had an early warning 
from the alarm.

Because the model is based on ACS data available nationwide, the analysis could be replicated—and fire safety 
improved—for other communities around the nation. The code for this analysis can be found online.48 You can

Skill Level: Introductory/intermediate 
Subject: County-level demographic and socioeconomic data 
Type of Analysis: Analysis and visualization of ACS data across the 20-county metro Atlanta region  
Tools Used: Data.census.gov, Excel, and data visualization tools 
Authors:  Taylor Tyger, Senior Planner, Atlanta Regional Commission 

Jim Skinner, Senior Principal Planner, Atlanta Regional Commission 
Mike Carnathan, Division Manager, Atlanta Regional Commission

The Atlanta Regional Commission’s (ARC) Research and Analytics Division uses various databases, analysis tools,
and visualization programs to improve data outreach in metro Atlanta. One of those tools is the Atlanta Region 
20-County Data Dashboard.50 This data dashboard was created to provide an interactive platform for users 
seeking demographic and socioeconomic information at the county level. The dashboard consolidates data from 
various data sources into eight categorical “bins”: population, employment, housing, education, health, crime, 
income, and forecasts. The designated “bins” were identified based on common data requests ARC receives.

We used the U.S. Census Bureau’s County Population Estimates and American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year 
estimates to “feed” parts of the dashboard (see Table 6.1). Some of the counties for which populations are 
included in the dashboard are fairly small. As a result, ACS 5-year estimates must be used instead of ACS 1-year 
estimates. Other data sources used in the dashboard include U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development, Georgia Department of Public Health, Georgia Department of Education, 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Atlanta Regional Commission forecasts.

While we recognize that there is a level of uncertainty associated with ACS estimates, the margins of error are 
not included in the dashboard. We considered two factors in the decision not to show margins of error. First, we 
wanted to present the information in a concise format for data users. Second, we wanted to present information 
in a consistent way across measures, and several measures in the dashboard from other sources do not have 
margins of sampling error.

To download the data, we used the data.census.gov Advanced Search option, as follows:

•  Go to the data.census.gov Web site at <https://data.census.gov>.

•  Click on “Advanced Search” under the search bar. This will bring you to the Advanced Search page.

U.S. Census BureauCase Study #3: USDA 515 Rental Housing Maturation

Skill Level: Introductory/Intermediate 
Subject: County-level rental housing data 
Type of Analysis: Analysis and visualization of counties’ affordable rental housing 
Tools Used: Data.census.gov, spreadsheet, and mapping software 
Author: Keith Wiley, Research Associate, Housing Assistance Council

The 2010–2014 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year data show that there are 5 million occupied rental 
housing units in rural areas.52 Since its inception in 1963, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Section 515 
Rural Rental Housing loan program has financed the construction of more than 533,000 affordable rental units, 
and it represents an important part of this housing stock. The program has received attention recently because 
a growing number of these loans will begin reaching maturity and will be paid off; an estimated 6,684 loans are 
expected to reach maturity over the next 20 years.53 After a loan is paid off, owners are under no obligation to 
maintain their properties as affordable housing and some fear many owners may no longer choose to do so.54 

Given that the distribution of Section 515 units is not uniform across rural areas, the risk to affordable housing 
stocks associated with maturing loans will be greater for some areas than others. The following approach uses 
the 2010–2014 ACS 5-year data to identify those counties where the USDA Section 515 properties represent a 
relatively large portion of the overall rental housing stock. These are the areas where policymakers may want to 
concentrate efforts to ameliorate the potential loss of this important affordable housing option.

The U.S. Census Bureau’s data.census.gov Web site provides easy access to 2010–2014 ACS 5-year occupied-
rental housing unit estimates. With these data, one can assess the role of the Section 515 program.

Steps:

•  Go to the data.census.gov Web site at <https://data.census.gov>.

•  Click on “Advanced Search” under the search bar. This brings you to the Advanced Search page  

(see Figure 6.19).

The next step is to join the 2010–2014 ACS 5-year data with Section 515 property data using a spreadsheet, and 
calculate the percentage of occupied rental units that are in the Section 515 program for each county.55 Counties 
where Section 515 occupied units make up 10 percent or more of the entire occupied rental housing stock are 
considered most at risk as these loans mature. The potential loss of 10 percent or more of all rental housing units 
would be problematic for most counties. These at-risk counties are home to approximately 13 percent of USDA 
Section 515 properties containing 48,378 occupied units (see Figure 6.27).

The final step is to use the data to create a map of at-risk counties across the nation (see Figure 6.28). Certain 
states, such as Alabama, Maine, Mississippi, and South Dakota, contain many of these counties.

Policymakers may want to monitor what occurs with these maturing loans over the next 10 to 15 years, particu-
larly in those counties where USDA Section 515 units represent at least one in every 10 rental units. If there is a 
considerable amount of attrition in these affordable housing units, it would most likely be in areas with higher 
concentrations of Section 515 housing units. Knowing where the loss would have the greatest impact can also 
help policymakers decide how best to use limited resources to address any problems. This issue is difficult to 
address, however, because it will unfold over many years.

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE

Sources of Error

The data in American Community Survey (ACS) products are estimates of the actual figures that would have 
been obtained if the entire population—rather than the chosen ACS sample—had been interviewed using the 
same methodology. All estimates produced from sample surveys have uncertainty associated with them as a 
result of being based on a sample of the population rather than the full population. This uncertainty—called sam-
pling error—means that estimates derived from the ACS will likely differ from the values that would have been 
obtained if the entire population had been included in the survey, as well as from values that would have been 
obtained had a different set of sample units been selected for the survey. 

Sampling error is the difference between an estimate based on a sample and the corresponding value that would 
be obtained if the estimate were based on the entire population. Measures of the magnitude of sampling error 
reflect the variation in the estimates over all possible samples that could have been selected from the population 
using the same sampling methodology. The margin of error is the measure of the magnitude of sampling error 
provided with all published ACS estimates.

In addition to sampling error, data users should recognize that other types of error—called nonsampling 
error—might also be introduced during any of the complex operations used to collect and process ACS data. 
Nonsampling error can result from problems in the sampling frame or survey questionnaires, mistakes in how 
the data are reported or coded, issues related to data processing or weighting, or problems related to inter-
viewer bias or nonresponse bias. Nonresponse bias results when survey respondents differ in meaningful ways 
from nonrespondents. Nonsampling error may affect ACS data by increasing the variability of the estimates or 
introducing bias into ACS results. The U.S. Census Bureau tries to minimize nonsampling error through exten-
sive research and evaluation of sampling techniques, questionnaire design, and data collection and processing 
procedures. 

Nonsampling error is very difficult to measure directly, but the Census Bureau provides a number of indirect 
measures to help inform users about the quality of ACS estimates. The section on “Measures of Nonsampling 
Error” includes a more detailed description of the different types of nonsampling error in the ACS and mea-
sures of ACS data quality. More information on ACS data quality measures for the nation and individual states is 
available on the Census Bureau’s Web page on Sample Size and Data Quality.56    

Measures of Sampling Error

Margins of Error and Confidence Intervals

A margin of error (MOE) describes the precision of an ACS estimate at a given level of confidence. The confi-
dence level associated with the MOE indicates the likelihood that the ACS sample estimate is within a certain 
range (the MOE) of the population value. The MOEs for published ACS estimates are provided at a 90 percent 
confidence level. From these MOEs, data users can easily calculate 90 percent confidence intervals that define a 
range expected to contain the true or population value of an estimate 90 percent of the time. For example, in the 
Data Profile for Selected Social Characteristics (Table DP02) for Colorado, a portion of which is shown in Figure 
7.1, data from the 2015 ACS 1-year estimates indicate that there were 564,757 one-person households in the state 
in 2015 with an MOE of 10,127. By adding and subtracting the MOE from the point estimate, we can calculate the 
90 percent confidence interval for that estimate: 

564,757 – 10,127 = 554,630 = Lower bound of the interval

564,757 + 10,127 = 574,884 = Upper bound of the interval

56 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, Sample Size and Data Quality, <www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample-size 

-and-data-quality/>.

564,757 – 10,127 = 554,630 = Lower bound of the interval 
564,757 + 10,127 = 574,884 = Upper bound of the interval

Source: U.S. Census Bureau, data.census.gov, Table DP02: “Selected Social Characteristics in the United States.”

Therefore, we can be 90 percent confident that the true number of one-person households in Colorado in 2015 
falls somewhere between 554,630 and 574,884. Put another way, if the ACS were independently conducted 100 
times in 2015, sampling theory suggests that 90 times the estimate of one-person households in Colorado would 
fall in the given confidence interval. Estimates with smaller MOEs—relative to the value of the estimate—will have 
narrower confidence intervals indicating that the estimate is more precise and has less sampling error associated 
with it.  

TIP: When constructing confidence intervals from MOEs, data users should be aware of any “natural” limits 
on the upper and lower bounds. For example, if a population estimate is near zero, the calculated value of the 
lower confidence bound may be less than zero. However, a negative number of people does not make sense, so 
the lower confidence bound should be reported as zero instead. 

For other estimates, such as income, negative values may be valid. Another natural limit would be 100 percent 
for the upper confidence bound of a percent estimate. Data users should always keep the context and meaning 
of an estimate in mind when creating and interpreting confidence intervals.

Standard Errors and Coefficients of Variation

A standard error (SE) measures the variability of an estimate due to sampling and provides the basis for calcu-
lating the MOE. The SE provides a quantitative measure of the extent to which an estimate derived from a sam-
ple can be expected to deviate from the value for the full population. SEs are needed to calculate coefficients of 

54   Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data 
54   What All Data Users Need to Know

U.S. Census Bureauvariation and to conduct tests of statistical significance. Data users can easily calculate the SE of an ACS esti-
mate by dividing the positive value of its MOE by 1.645 as shown below:57

Using the data in Table 7.1, the SE for the number of one-person households in Colorado in 2015 would be:

(1)

The SE for an estimate depends on the underlying variability in the population for that characteristic and the 
sample size used for the survey. In general, the larger the sample size, the smaller the SE of the estimates pro-
duced from the sample data. This relationship between sample size and SE is the reason that ACS estimates for 
less populous areas are only published using multiple years of data. Combining data from multiple ACS 1-year 
files increases sample size and helps to reduce SEs.

Coefficients of variation are another useful measure of sampling error. A coefficient of variation (CV) measures 
the relative amount of sampling error that is associated with a sample estimate. The CV is calculated as the ratio 
of the SE for an estimate to the estimate itself 

 and is usually expressed as a percent:

A small CV indicates that the SE is small relative to the estimate, and a data user can be more confident that the 
estimate is close to the population value. The CV is also an indicator of the reliability of an estimate. When the 
SE of an estimate is close to the value of the estimate, the CV will be larger, indicating that the estimate has a 
large amount of sampling error associated with it and is not very reliable. For the example of one-person house-
holds in Colorado, the CV would be calculated as:58  

(2)

A CV of 1.1 percent indicates that the ACS estimate of one-person households in Colorado has a relatively small 
amount of sampling error and is quite reliable. Data users often find it easier to interpret and compare CVs 
across a series of ACS estimates than to interpret and compare SEs.

There are no hard-and-fast rules for determining an acceptable range of error in ACS estimates. Instead, data users 
must evaluate each application to determine the level of precision that is needed for an ACS estimate to be useful. 
For more information, visit the Census Bureau’s Web page on Data Suppression.59

Determining Statistical Significance

One of the most important uses of ACS data is to make comparisons between estimates—across different geo-
graphic areas, different time periods, or different population subgroups. Data users may also want to compare 
ACS estimates with data from past decennial censuses. For any comparisons based on ACS data, it is important 
to take into account the sampling error associated with each estimate through the use of a statistical test for 
significance. This test shows whether the observed difference between estimates likely represents a true differ-
ence that exists within the full population (is statistically significant) or instead has occurred by chance because 
of sampling (is not statistically significant). Statistical significance means that there is strong statistical evidence 

57 Data users working with ACS 1-year estimates for 2005 or earlier should divide the MOE by the value 1.65 as that was the value used to de-

rive the published MOE from the SE in those years.

58 The examples provided in this section use unrounded values in their calculations, but the values displayed are rounded to three decimal 
places. For percentages that use a numerator or denominator from a prior example, the unrounded value is used, although the rounded value is

that a true difference exists within the full population. Data users should not rely on overlapping confidence 
intervals as a test for statistical significance because this method will not always provide an accurate result.

When comparing two ACS estimates, a test for significance can be carried out by making several calculations 
using the estimates and their corresponding SEs. These calculations are straightforward given the published 
MOEs available for ACS estimates in data.census.gov and many other Census Bureau data products. The steps to 
test for a statistically significant difference between two ACS estimates are as follows:

1.  Calculate the SEs for the two ACS estimates using formula (1).
2.  Square the resulting SE for each estimate.
3.  Sum the squared SEs.
4.  Calculate the square root of the sum of the squared SEs.
5.  Divide the difference between the two ACS estimates by the square root of the sum of the squared SEs.
6.  Compare the absolute value of the result from Step 5 with the critical value for the desired level of confi-

7. 

dence (1.645 for 90 percent, 1.960 for 95 percent, or 2.576 for 99 percent).
If the absolute value of the result from Step 5 is greater than the critical value, then the difference between 
the two estimates can be considered statistically significant, at the level of confidence corresponding to the 
critical value selected in Step 6.

Algebraically, the significance test can be expressed as follows:

If

then the difference between estimates

 and 

 is statistically significant at the specified confidence  

 are the estimates being compared 

 and 
where 
SE1 is the SE for estimate 
SE2 is the SE for estimate 

ZCL is the critical value for the desired confidence level (1.645 for 90 percent, 1.960 for 95 percent, and 2.576 for 
99 percent).

The example below shows how to determine if the difference in the estimated percentage of householders age 
65 or older who live alone between Florida (estimated percentage = 12.6, MOE = 0.2) and Arizona (estimated 
percentage = 10.5, MOE = 0.3) is statistically significant, based on 2015 ACS data. Using formula (1) above, first 
calculate the corresponding standard errors for Florida (0.122) and Arizona (0.182) by dividing the MOEs by 
1.645. Then, using formula (3) above, calculate the test value as follows:

Since the test value (9.581) is greater than the critical value for a confidence level of 90 percent (1.645), the dif-
ference in the percentages is statistically significant at a 90 percent confidence level. A rough interpretation of 
the result is that the user can be 90 percent certain that a difference exists between the percentage of house-
holders aged 65 or older who live alone in Florida and in Arizona.

By contrast, if the corresponding estimate for Indiana (estimated percentage = 10.8, MOE = 0.2, SE = 0.122) were 
compared with the estimate for Arizona, formula (3) would yield:

Since the test value (1.369) is less than the critical value for a confidence level of 90 percent (1.645), the differ-
ence in percentages is not statistically significant. A rough interpretation of the result is that the user cannot be 
certain to any sufficient degree that the observed difference in the estimates between Indiana and Arizona was 
not due to chance.

The Census Bureau has produced a Statistical Testing Tool to make it easier for ACS data users to conduct tests 
of statistical significance when comparing ACS estimates.60 This tool consists of an Excel spreadsheet that will 
automatically calculate statistical significance when data users are comparing two ACS estimates or multiple 
estimates. Data users simply need to download ACS data from the Census Bureau’s data.census.gov Web site 
and insert the estimate and MOE into the correct columns and cells in the spreadsheet. The results are calculated 
automatically. The result “Yes” indicates that estimates are statistically different and the result “No” indicates the 
estimates are not statistically different.61

Custom (User-Derived) Estimates

In some cases, data users will need to construct custom ACS estimates by combining data across multiple geo-
graphic areas or population subgroups, or it may be necessary to derive a new percentage, proportion, or ratio 
from published ACS data. For example, one way to address the issue of unreliable estimates for individual census 
tracts or block groups is to aggregate geographic areas, yielding larger samples and more reliable estimates. 
In such cases, additional calculations are needed to produce MOEs and SEs, and to conduct tests of statistical 
significance for the derived estimates. The section on “Calculating Measures of Error for Derived Estimates” pro-
vides detailed instructions on how to make these calculations. 

60 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS), Statistical Testing Tool, <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance 

/statistical-testing-tool.html>.

61 This tool only conducts statistical testing on the estimates keyed in by the data user for comparison within the spreadsheet, and it does not 

adjust the MOE when making multiple comparisons, nor incorporate a Bonferroni correction or any other method in the results of the statistical 
testing.

U.S. Census BureauAdvanced users who are aggregating ACS estimates can use the Census Bureau’s Variance Replicate Tables 
to produce MOEs for selected ACS 5-year Detailed Tables.62 Users can calculate MOEs for aggregated data by 
using the variance replicates. Unlike available approximation formulas, this method results in an exact MOE by 
incorporating the covariance. More information about the Variance Replicate Tables is available in the section on 
“Calculating Measures of Error for Derived Estimates.”

Some advanced data users will also want to construct custom ACS estimates from the Census Bureau’s Public 
Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files. Separate instructions for calculating SEs and conducting significance tests 
for PUMS estimates are available on the Census Bureau’s PUMS Technical Documentation Web page.63

It is important for data users to remember that the error measures and statistical tests described in this sec-
tion do not tell us about the magnitude of nonsampling errors. More information about those types of errors is 
available in the section on “Measures of Nonsampling Error.”

DERIVED ESTIMATES

The U.S. Census Bureau publishes a wide range of American Community Survey (ACS) estimates through the data 
products provided in data.census.gov and the ACS Summary File. However, for some applications, data users may 
still need to construct custom ACS estimates and their associated margins of error (MOEs). For example, users 
may want to aggregate data across geographic areas or population subgroups, or may need to derive proportions, 
ratios, and percent change measures that are not provided in published ACS data products. 

TIP: Data users can also aggregate data across geographic areas—or across population subgroups—to produce 
more reliable estimates in cases where the underlying component areas have estimates with relatively large 
standard errors (SEs).

When such derived estimates are generated, the user must calculate the associated MOEs. As described in the 
section on “Understanding Error and Determining Statistical Significance,” MOEs are needed to calculate SEs 
and coefficients of variation (CVs) and to determine statistical significance. The steps outlined in the sections 
below illustrate how to calculate the MOEs for derived counts, proportions, percentages, ratios, and percent 
change, which can then be translated into SEs and CVs. 

Calculating Measures of Error for Aggregated Count Data

Aggregating Data Across Geographic Areas

For some applications, data users may want to know the number of people with certain characteristics within a 
particular geographic region that is not included as a standard geographic area in ACS products. For example, 
a user may be interested in the number of never-married females within a tri-county area. The example below 
shows how to calculate the MOE, SE, and CV for such a derived estimate.     

To calculate the MOE for aggregated count data:

1.  Obtain the MOE of each component estimate.
2.  Square the MOE of each component estimate.
3.  Sum the squared MOEs.
4.  Take the square root of the sum of the squared MOEs.
The result is the MOE for the aggregated count. Algebraically, the MOE for the aggregated count is calculated 
as:

(1)

The example below shows how to calculate the MOE and SE for the estimated number of never-married females 
living in the three Virginia counties/independent cities that border Washington, DC (Fairfax and Arlington coun-
ties, Alexandria City) from the 2015 ACS 1-year estimates.

U.S. Census BureauThe aggregate estimate is:

Obtain MOEs of the component estimates:

 MOE (Fairfax)       = ±3,860
 MOE (Arlington)   = ±2,642 
MOE (Alexandria) = ±1,957

Using formula (1), calculate the MOE for the aggregate estimate:

Thus, the derived estimate of the number of never-married females living in the three Virginia counties/indepen-
dent cities that border Washington, DC, is 203,119, and the MOE for the estimate is ±5,070. 

The SE of this derived estimate can be calculated from the SEs of the component estimates as follows:

1. Calculate the SE of each component estimate from its MOE using:  

SE (Fairfax)       = 3,860 / 1.645 = 2,347
SE (Arlington)   = 2,642 / 1.645 = 1,606
           SE (Alexandria)   = 1,957 / 1.645 = 1,190

2. Calculate the SE of the aggregate estimate:

With the three component estimates in this example, this becomes:

To assess the reliability of this derived estimate, users may find it helpful to calculate the CV as follows:

This CV indicates that the sampling error of this estimate is very small relative to the estimate itself, so the num-
ber of never-married females residing in the Virginia tri-county area bordering Washington, DC, can be consid-
ered a very reliable estimate. 

However, users should note that this method for calculating the MOE and SE for aggregated count data is an 
approximation, and caution is warranted because this method does not consider the correlation or covariance 
between the component estimates. This method may result in an overestimate or underestimate of the derived 
estimate’s SE depending on whether the component estimates are highly correlated in either a positive or nega-
tive direction. As a result, the approximated SE may not match the result from a direct calculation of the SE that 
does include a measure of covariance, such as the following:

(5)

Data users should also be aware that as the number of estimates involved in a sum or difference increases, the 
results of the approximation formula become increasingly different from the SE derived directly from the ACS 
microdata. Users are encouraged to work with the fewest number of estimates possible. If there are estimates 
involved in a sum that are controlled in the weighting, then the approximate SE can be increasingly different. 
Several examples are provided to demonstrate issues associated with approximating the SEs when summing 
large numbers of estimates together in the latest ACS Worked Examples for Approximating Margins of Error 
document.64

Aggregating Data Across Population Subgroups

For some applications, data users may wish to combine data across population subgroups, especially in ACS 
tables where some groups have low counts and large MOEs. Before aggregating categories in a Detailed Table 
to create a derived estimate, users should check to make sure there is not a collapsed version of the same table 
already available in data.census.gov or the ACS Summary File. The MOEs in the published, collapsed tables will 
be more accurate than those users can approximate using the methods described in this section. 

The example below illustrates the results from aggregating household income categories from a Detailed Table 
in data.census.gov for Loudoun County, Virginia, from the 2015 ACS 1-year estimates. Income categories are 
organized into three subgroups for the purpose of this example.

After calculating the SEs and CVs shown in Table 8.2, a data user might want to combine some of the household 
income categories in the lower end of the income distribution to reduce the CVs and create more reliable esti-
mates. For example, the income categories in Subgroup 1 ($15,000 to $19,999 and $20,000 to $24,999) could be 
combined to form the first new subgroup, the two in Subgroup 2 ($25,000 to $29,999 and $30,000 to $34,999) 
to form a second new subgroup, and the three in Subgroup 3 ($35,000 to $39,999, $40,000 to $44,999, and 
$45,000 to $49,999) to form a third new subgroup. Following the same steps used to combine data across three 
geographic areas in Example 1, derived estimates and MOEs for the three new subgroups could be calculated as 
follows:

1.  Aggregate counts to form new subgroup estimates:

•  Subgroup 1 ($15,000 to $24,999) = 1,502 + 1,995 = 3,497 
•  Subgroup 2 ($25,000 to $34,999) = 1,756 + 1,781 = 3,537
•  Subgroup 3 ($35,000 to $49,999) = 2,708 + 1,981 + 2,581 = 7,270

2.  Using formula (1), calculate MOEs for each new subgroup estimate:

Aggregating across income categories increases the reliability of the new subgroup estimates relative to the 
original component estimates. For example, the CV for the $15,000 to $19,999 category is 30 percent. When 
this category is combined with the $20,000 to $24,999 category, the CV for the derived estimate for the new 
Subgroup 1 drops to 18 percent—lower than the original CV for this category by itself. Similarly, the CVs for the 
component estimates of Subgroup 3 range from 20 percent to 24 percent, while the CV for the derived estimate 
for Subgroup 3 ($35,000 to $49,999) is only 13 percent.

While the MOEs, SEs, and CVs for new Subgroup 1 and Subgroup 3 are almost identical to those derived from

with the published MOE of ±973, and the derived CV is only 16.0 percent compared with a CV of 16.7 percent 
based on the published MOE for Subgroup 2. The approximation method slightly underestimates the MOE and 
SE for Subgroup 2 because it does not account for some covariance between the two component estimates. 
Although the differences between the user-derived and published MOE’s are small in this example, they can vary 
substantially in other cases, particularly for linear combinations of multiple estimates. Examples illustrating this 
problem are provided in the ACS Worked Examples for Approximating Margins of Error document (see section 
on “Issues with Approximating the Standard Error of Linear Combinations of Multiple Estimates”).65

Calculating Measures of Error for User-Derived Proportions and Percentages

When data users create derived estimates for aggregated count data, they are often interested in calculating 
additional measures such as proportions and percentages. For example, the user who calculated the number of 
never-married females in the tri-county area in northern Virginia might also want to know what proportion of all 
females in this region have never been married. With proportions, the numerator is a subset of the denomina-
tor. In this case, the number of never-married females is a subset of all females. This derived proportion would

To calculate the MOE of this proportion, we need the MOEs of the numerator (203,119) and the denominator

mated percentage.

Calculating Measures of Error for Derived Ratios

Ratios are used to compare two estimates where the numerator is not a subset of the denominator. For example, 
the data user in Example 1 may want to compare the number of never-married males in the tri-county area to the 
number of never-married females. To do this, the user must first obtain the component estimates and MOEs for 
males, and calculate the derived estimate and MOE of the number of never-married males in the tri-county area. 
These data, from the 2015 ACS 1-year estimates, are shown in Table 8.5 below.

Using the derived estimate and MOE calculated in Example 1 in this section, and the data from Table 8.5, the ratio 
would be calculated as:

Ratio = (Never-married males / Never-married females)

Ratio = ((156,720 + 44,613 + 25,507) / 203,119) = (226,840 / 203,119) = 1.117

This means that there were approximately 112 never-married men for every 100 never-married women living in 
the three Virginia counties in 2015.

Using formula (1), the MOE of the derived estimate of never-married males is calculated as:

A ratio has a slightly different estimator for the MOE than a proportion. If 
never-married males and 
as:

 = the number of never-married females, then the MOE of this ratio is approximated 

, where 

 = the number of 

Substituting the estimates for the numerator and denominator, and their respective MOEs in this formula yields:

(7)

Using formula (2), the SE of the ratio is 0.039 / 1.645 = 0.024. Using formula (4), the CV for the ratio of never-
married males to never-married females is (0.024 / 1.117) * 100 = 2.1 percent, indicating that this is a very reliable 
estimate with an SE that is much smaller than the value of the estimated ratio.

Calculating Measures of Error for Derived Estimates of Percent Change

One of the most important benefits of annual releases of ACS estimates is the ability it provides for data users 
to analyze change over time. A frequent application is to calculate the percent change from one time period to 
another. For example, users may want to calculate the percent change from a 2009–2013 ACS 5-year estimate to 
a 2014–2018 ACS 5-year estimate. Normally, the current estimate is compared with the older estimate. 

If the current estimate = 

 and the earlier estimate = 

, then the MOE for percent change is calculated as follows:

(8)

Formula (8) reduces to a ratio, so the ratio formula (7) described in the section above should be used to calcu-
late the MOE. As a caveat, users should be aware that this formula does not take into account the correlation 
when calculating a change between two overlapping time periods. To calculate standard errors for overlapping 
ACS multiyear estimates see the section on “Understanding Error and Determining Statistical Significance.” 

Calculating Measures of Error for the Product of Two Estimates 

In some instances, data users may need to derive an estimate by multiplying a published count by a published 
percentage. For example, a data user might be interested in the number of 1-unit detached owner-occupied 
housing units in a geographic area. In 2015, the number of owner-occupied housing units in the United States 
was 74,506,512 with an MOE of 228,238, and the percent of 1-unit detached owner-occupied housing units was 
82.4 (0.824) with an MOE of 0.1 percent (0.001).66 So, the number of 1-unit detached owner-occupied housing 
units was 74,506,512 * 0.824 = 61,393,366. The formula to calculate the MOE of a product is:

Substituting the estimates and their respective MOEs in formula (9) yields:

(9)

To obtain the lower and upper bounds of the 90 percent confidence interval around 61,393,366, add and subtract 
the MOE from 61,393,366. Thus, the 90 percent confidence interval for this estimate is [61,393,366 – 202,289] to 
[61,393,366 + 202,289] or 61,191,077 to 61,595,655. Using formula (2), the SE of the product is 202,289 / 1.645 = 
122,972. Using formula (4), the coefficient of variation for this derived estimate is (122,972 / 61,393,366) * 100 = 
0.2 percent, indicating that the derived estimate is very reliable.

Advanced users may be interested in the Variance Replicate Tables, first released for the 2010–2014 ACS 5-year 
data in July 2016.67 These augmented ACS Detailed Tables include sets of 80 replicate estimates, which allow 
users to calculate measures of error for derived estimates using the same methods that are used to produce 
the published MOEs in data.census.gov. These methods incorporate the covariance between estimates that the

DECENNIAL CENSUS

While the main function of the U.S. decennial cen-
sus is to provide counts of people for the purpose of 
congressional apportionment, the primary purpose of 
the American Community Survey (ACS) is to measure 
the changing social and economic characteristics of 
the U.S. population—our education, housing, jobs, and 
more. 

Every 10 years since 1790, Congress has authorized 
the government to conduct a national census of the 
U.S. population, as required by the U.S. Constitution. 
In every decennial census from 1940 through 2000, 
two questionnaires were used to collect information: 
a “short form” with only basic questions such as age, 
sex, race, and Hispanic origin; and a “long form” with 
the basic short-form questions plus additional ques-
tions on social, economic, and housing characteristics. 
Only a subset of households received the long-form 
questionnaire—about one in every six in 2000. 

After the 2000 Census, the long form was replaced 
by the ACS, which continued to collect long-form 
type information throughout the decade. The ACS 
includes not only the basic short-form questions, but 
also detailed questions about population and housing 
characteristics. It is a nationwide, continuous survey 
designed to provide communities with reliable and 
timely social, economic, housing, and demographic 
data every year. Since its start, the ACS has been pro-
viding a continuous stream of updated information for 
states and local areas, and is revolutionizing the way 
we use statistics to understand our communities. 

There are many similarities between the ACS and the 
2000 Census long form. Both data sources are based 
on information from samples of the population, and 
while there are some differences in the question word-
ing between the ACS and the 2000 Census long form, 
many questions in the two forms are very similar. 
However, there are also important differences in resi-
dence rules, reference periods, definitions, and meth-
ods between the two data sources that can impact 
comparability between ACS and 2000 Census data. 
For detailed guidance on comparing ACS and 2000 
Census data, visit the Census Bureau’s Web page on 
Comparing ACS Data.69 

Residence Rules and Reference Periods

The fundamentally different purposes of the ACS and 
the decennial census and their timing led to important 
differences in the choice of data collection methods. 

69 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS), 
Comparing ACS Data, <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs 
/guidance/comparing-acs-data.html>. 

The decennial census residence rules, which deter-
mine where people should be counted, are based on 
the principle of “usual residence” on April 1, in keeping 
with the focus of the census on the requirements of 
congressional apportionment and state redistricting. 
To accomplish this, the decennial census attempts to 
restrict and determine a principal place of residence 
on one specific date for everyone enumerated. 

The ACS uses a “current residence” rule to inter-
view people who are currently living or staying in 
the sample housing unit as long as their stay at that 
address will exceed 2 months (see Box 9.1 for more 
information). This method is consistent with the goal 
that the Census Bureau produce ACS estimates based 
on data collected over a period of time, rather than a 
single point in time. ACS 1-year estimates represent 
data that have been collected over a 12-month period, 
and 5-year estimates represent data collected over a 
period of 60 months.

Therefore, a key difference between the ACS and the 
decennial census is the overall time frame in which 
they are conducted. The distribution of census enu-
meration dates are highly clustered in March and 
April (when most census mail returns are received) 
with additional, smaller clusters seen in May and June 
(when nonresponse follow-up activities take place). 
This means that the data from the decennial census 
tend to describe the characteristics of the population 
and housing in the March through June time period 
(with an overrepresentation of March and April), while 
ACS data describe the characteristics nearly every day 
over the full calendar year.  

The differences in the ACS and census data as a 
consequence of the different residence rules are most 
likely minimal for most areas and most characteristics. 
However, for certain segments of the population, the 
usual and current residence concepts could result in 
different residence decisions. Appreciable differences 
may occur in areas where large proportions of the 
total population spend several months of the year in 
areas that would not be considered their residence 
under decennial census rules. In particular, data for 
areas that include large beach, lake, or mountain 
vacation areas, or large migrant worker communities 
may differ appreciably between the decennial census 
and the ACS if populations live there for more than 2 
months.

68   What All Data Users Need to Know

U.S. Census BureauBox 9.1. Who Counts as a “Resident” in the ACS?

The ACS uses the concept of “current residence” to determine who should be considered residents of 
sample housing units. The basic idea behind this concept is that everyone who is currently living or stay-
ing at an address for more than 2 months is considered a current resident of that address.

This means that their expected length of stay is more than 2 months, not that they have been staying 
in the housing unit for more than 2 months at the time when the survey is conducted. A person away 
from their residence for 2 months or less, whether in the United States or overseas, on a vacation or on 
a business trip, is considered to be a “resident” at the address, and the unit is classified as occupied and 
eligible for inclusion in the survey. A person away from their residence for more than 2 months is consid-
ered not to be a resident. For the ACS, if no one is determined to be a current resident in the sampled 
housing unit, it is classified as “vacant.”

There are a few exceptions to the “2-month” rule:

People Without Another Place to Stay: Anyone staying at a residence who does not have 
another place to stay, even if they are at the residence for 2 months or less, are always consid-
ered current residents of the residence.

Children Away at School: Children (under college age) who are away at boarding school or 
summer camp for more than 2 months are always considered current residents of their parents’ 
homes. College students’ current residency is established by the 2-month rule.

Children in Joint Custody: Children who live under joint custody agreements and move between 
residences are always considered current residents of the sampled housing unit where they are 
staying at the time of the interview.

“Commuter Workers”: People who stay at a residence close to work and return regularly to 
another residence to be with their family are always considered current residents of the family 
residence, not the work-related residence.

Residency in group quarters facilities is determined differently. All people residing in the selected facility 
at the time of interview, regardless of the length of stay, are eligible to be selected to be interviewed in 
the ACS.

Some of the specific differences in reference periods 
between the ACS and 2000 Census are described on 
the next page. Data users should consider the poten-
tial impact of these differences when comparing ACS 
with 2000 Census estimates. 

Employment Status (Compare With 
Caution)

The reference periods are different because of year-
round ACS data collection. The ACS reference period 
is the week before the respondent completed the 
survey or the field representative conducted the 
interview. Because questionnaires are mailed and field 
interviews are conducted throughout the year, there 
is a revolving reference period. For the 2000 Census, 
the reference period was the week before Census Day 
(April 1, 2000).

Income and Earnings Data (Compare With 
Caution)

t 

The ACS asks for a respondent’s income over the “pas
12 months.” For example, the 2018 ACS 1-year data 
reflect incomes over 2017–2018, and the 2014–2018 
ACS 5-year data reflect incomes over 2013–2018. The 
2000 Census, however, collected the income data for 
a fixed period of time—“during 1999” (the last calen-
dar year). In a comparison study between the 2000 
Census income data and the 2000 ACS, income col-
lected in the 2000 Census was found to be about 4 
percent higher than that in the 2000 ACS. For more 
information on the differences of income in the ACS 
and the 2000 Census, visit the Census Bureau’s Web

Occupants Per Room

The ACS reference period was 3 months preceding 
the date of interview, while the 2000 Census reference 
period was any time since February 1, 2000.

Definitions 

Many data items collected in both the ACS and the 
2000 Census long form have slightly different defini-
tions that could affect the comparability of the esti-
mates for these items. Some of the specific differences 
in subject or variable definitions between the ACS and 
the 2000 Census are described below. For a compre-
hensive list, visit the Census Bureau’s Web page on 
Subject Definitions.71

Group Quarters

The total group quarters (GQ) population in the ACS 
may not be comparable with decennial census counts 
because there are some GQ types that are out of 
scope in the ACS. These include domestic violence 
shelters, soup kitchens, regularly scheduled mobile 
food vans, targeted nonsheltered outdoor locations, 
crews on maritime vessels, and living quarters for 
victims of natural disasters. The exclusion of these 
GQ types from the ACS may result in a small bias in 
some ACS estimates to the extent that the excluded 
population is different from the included population. 
Furthermore, only a sample of GQ facilities through-
out the United States and Puerto Rico are selected for 
the ACS. The ACS controls the GQ sample at the state 
level only. Therefore, for lower levels of geography, 
particularly when there are relatively few GQs in a geo-
graphic area, the ACS estimate of the GQ population 
may vary from the count from the decennial census.

Aggregate Gross Rent

Data on gross rent in the ACS should not be com-
pared with 2000 Census gross rent data. For the 2000 
Census, tables were not released for total renter- 
occupied units. The universe in the 2000 Census 
was “specified renter-occupied housing units,” which 
excluded one-family houses on 10 acres or more, 
whereas the universe in the ACS is “renter-occupied 
housing units,” thus, comparisons cannot be made 
between these two data sets.

71 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS), Code 
Lists, Definitions, and Accuracy, <www.census.gov/programs-surveys 
/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html>.

Data on occupants per room in the ACS should be 
compared with the 2000 Census with caution. This 
is due to: (1) differences in residence rules, (2) the 
absence of population controls used to adjust for 
undercoverage in the reported number of current 
residents in the ACS used in this measure, and (3) dif-
ferences in the reported number of rooms because of 
changes in the rooms question between the 2007 and 
2008 ACS.

Data Collection Modes

Until 2015, the Census Bureau sent all selected 
addresses an advance notification letter inform-
ing people living at that address that they had been 
selected to participate in the ACS. Shortly thereafter 
(for most U.S. addresses), instructions for complet-
ing the survey by Internet were mailed. Beginning 
in August 2015, the Census Bureau eliminated the 
advance notification letter and instead included 
instructions in the initial mail package for complet-
ing the survey by Internet or over the phone through 
a toll-free Telephone Questionnaire Assistance (TQA) 
line. If households do not respond by Internet or TQA, 
then a paper questionnaire is mailed to the address. 
In Puerto Rico and some hard-to-reach areas, only a 
paper questionnaire is mailed. 

Until 2017, if no response was received by Internet, 
TQA, or mail within a month following the initial mail-
ing, the Census Bureau followed up with a telephone 
interview when a telephone number was available. 
However, beginning in October 2017, the Census 
Bureau discontinued the telephone Nonresponse 
Followup operation because of declining response 
rates and increasing costs. Respondent data are still 
collected via telephone through the TQA operation.

If the Census Bureau is unable to get a response 
by Internet, mail, or TQA, then the address may be 
selected for an in-person interview. Because of the 
high cost per completed interview, the Census Bureau 
samples about one in three nonrespondent housing 
units for personal visit interviews. The proportion of 
nonresponding households selected for in-person 
interviews is higher in areas with lower predicted 
response rates. A sample of people living in group 
quarters facilities—such as college dorms, skilled nurs-
ing facilities, or correctional facilities—is also inter-
viewed in person to ensure coverage of people who 
are not living in housing units.

This Web page provides guidance on making com-

Census Table Comparison Tool to match ACS 5-year 
tables with corresponding tables from the 2000 
Census.

Like the ACS, the primary modes of data collection in 
the 2000 Census and the 2010 Census were mail-out/
mail-back questionnaires, telephone, and in-person 
visits. Unlike the ACS, enumerators for the decennial 
census attempted to follow up with all nonresponding 
households through telephone or personal interviews. 
Data for those who could not be contacted or who 
refused to participate were collected through “proxy” 
interviews, which means interviewers attempted to 
find and get a response from a knowledgeable respon-
dent who was not a member of the household. Neither 
the 2000 Census nor the 2010 Census included an 
Internet response option, although the Census Bureau 
is providing this option in the 2020 Census. 

Sampling and Nonsampling Error

ACS data, like the data from the 2000 Census long 
form, are derived from a sample of the population 
and are therefore subject to sampling error. The 2000 
Census sample—consisting of about one in six house-
holds nationwide—is larger than the 5-year aggregated 
ACS sample designed to replace it. Therefore, there is 
more sampling error associated with the ACS 5-year 
estimates, compared with estimates from the 2000 
Census long form. However, compared with the 2000 
Census, the ACS has lower levels of nonresponse 
error—as measured through survey response rates 
and item nonresponse rates. Visit the sections on 
“Understanding Error and Determining Statistical 
Significance” and “Measures of Nonsampling Error” for 
more information.

U.S. Census Bureau10. USING DOLLAR-DENOMINATED DATA

Dollar-denominated data refer to any characteristics for which inflation adjustments are used when produc-
ing annual estimates or comparing estimates across time periods. For example, income, rent, home value, and 
energy costs across time periods are all dollar-denominated data.

Inflation will affect the comparability of dollar-denominated data across time periods. When American 
Community Survey (ACS) multiyear estimates for dollar-denominated data are generated, amounts are adjusted 
using national Consumer Price Index (CPI) annual averages, since a regional-based CPI is not available for the 
entire country.

Given the potential impact of inflation on observed differences of dollar-denominated data across time periods, 
ACS data users should adjust for the effects of inflation. Such an adjustment will provide comparable estimates 
accounting for inflation. In making adjustments, the U.S. Census Bureau recommends using factors based on the 
All-Items CPI-U-RS (CPI Research Series).72 Explanations follow.

Creating Single-Year Income Values

ACS income values are reported based on the amount of income received during the 12 months preceding the 
interview month. This is the income reference period. Since there are 12 different income reference periods 
throughout an interview year, 12 different income inflation adjustments are made. Monthly CPI-U-RSs are used to 
inflation-adjust the 12 reference period incomes to a single reference period of January through December of the 
interview year. Note that there are no inflation adjustments for 1-year estimates of rent, home value, or energy 
cost values.

Adjusting Single-Year Estimates Over Time

When comparing 1-year income, rent, home value, and energy cost value estimates from two different years, 
adjustments should be made as follows: 

1.   Obtain the All Items CPI-U-RS Annual Averages for the 2 years being compared.

2.   Calculate the inflation adjustment factor as the ratio of the CPI-U-RS from the more recent year to the  

  CPI-U-RS from the earlier year.

3.   Multiply the dollar-denominated data estimated for the earlier year by the inflation adjustment factor. You  
  can also follow this same process to calculate the corresponding margin of error of the inflation-adjusted  
  estimate.

The inflation-adjusted estimate for the earlier year can be expressed as:

where 
Annual Average for the more recent year (Y2); and 

 is the All Items CPI-U-RS Annual Average for the earlier year (Y1); 

 is the published ACS estimate for the earlier year (Y1).

The example below compares the national median value for owner-occupied mobile homes in 2014 ($38,400) 
and 2015 ($44,000). First adjust the 2014 median value using the 2014 All Items CPI-U-RS Annual Average 
(348.3) and the 2015 All Items CPI-U-RS Annual Average (348.9) as follows:

Formula 10.1:

Thus, the comparison of the national median value for owner-occupied mobile homes in 2014 and 2015, in 2015 
dollars, would be $38,466 (2014 inflation-adjusted to 2015 dollars) versus $44,000 (2015 dollars).

U.S. Census BureauCreating Values Used in Multiyear Estimates

Multiyear income, rent, home value, and energy cost values are created with inflation adjustments. The Census 
Bureau uses the All Items CPI-U-RS Annual Averages for each year in the multiyear time period to calculate a 
set of inflation adjustment factors. Adjustment factors for a time period are calculated as ratios of the CPI-U-RS 
Annual Average from the most recent year to the CPI-U-RS Annual Averages from each of the earlier years. 
The ACS values for each of the earlier years in the multiyear period are multiplied by the appropriate inflation 
adjustment factors to produce the inflation-adjusted values. These values are then used to create the multiyear 
estimates.  

As an illustration, consider the time period 2014–2018, with hypothetical individual reference-year income values 
ranging from $15,000 in 2014 to $30,000 in 2018 (see Table 10.1).

In this example, the multiyear income components are created from inflation-adjusted income values using the 
CPI-U-RS Annual Averages shown in the third column of the table. The inflation-adjusted 2017 value is the ratio 
of 369.8 to 361.0 applied to $30,000, which equals $30,731. The same calculation is applied to the income values 
from 2014 through 2016 to produce inflation-adjusted values for those years. These individual values are then 
used to create the multiyear estimate for the 2014–2018 time period.

Adjusting Multiyear Estimates Over Time

When comparing multiyear estimates from two different time periods, adjustments should be made as follows:

1.  Obtain the latest available All Items CPI-U-RS Annual Averages for the two periods being compared.

2.  Calculate the inflation adjustment factor as the ratio of the CPI-U-RS Annual Average in formula (1) from the 

most recent year to the CPI-U-RS in formula (1) from the earlier year.

3.  Multiply the dollar-denominated estimate for the earlier time period by the inflation adjustment factor. You 

can also follow this same process to calculate the corresponding margin of error of the inflation-adjusted 
estimate.

The inflation-adjusted estimate for the earlier year can be expressed as:   

where 

 is the All Items CPI-U-RS Annual Average for the last year in the earlier time period (P1). 

 is the All Items CPI-U-RS Annual Average for the last year in the most current time period (P2). 

is the published ACS estimate for the earlier time period (P1).

2014, in 2014 dollars, would be $45,085 (2005–2009 inflation-adjusted to 2014 dollars) versus $39,000 (2010–
2014, already in 2014 dollars).

Issues Associated With Inflation Adjustment

The recommended inflation adjustment uses a national-level CPI and, thus, will not reflect inflation differences 
that may exist across different geographic areas. In addition, since the inflation adjustment uses the All Items 
CPI, it will not reflect differences that may exist across characteristics such as energy and housing costs.

U.S. Census Bureau11. MEASURES OF NONSAMPLING ERROR

All survey estimates are subject to both sampling and 
nonsampling error. In the section on “Understanding 
Error and Determining Statistical Significance,” the 
topic of sampling error and the various measures 
available for understanding the uncertainty in the esti-
mates due to their being based on estimates derived 
from a sample, rather than from an entire population, 
are discussed. The margins of error published with 
American Community Survey (ACS) estimates mea-
sure only the effect of sampling error. Other errors that 
affect the overall accuracy of the survey estimates may 
occur in the course of collecting and processing the 
ACS and are referred to collectively as nonsampling 
errors.

Broadly speaking, nonsampling error refers to any 
error affecting a survey estimate outside of sam-
pling error. Nonsampling error can occur in complete 
censuses as well as in sample surveys, and is com-
monly recognized as including coverage error, unit 
nonresponse, item nonresponse, response error, and 
processing error. The U.S. Census Bureau has many 
procedures in place designed to reduce these sources 
of nonsampling error and thus improve the quality of 
the data. More information about these procedures is 
available in the section on “Improving Data Quality by 
Reducing Nonsampling Error” on the Census Bureau’s 
Design and Methodology Report Web page.73

Types of Nonsampling Error

Nonsampling error can result in both random errors 
and systematic errors. Of greatest concern are system-
atic errors. Random errors are less critical since they 
tend to cancel out at higher geographic levels in large 
samples such as the ACS.

On the other hand, systematic errors tend to accu-
mulate over the entire sample. For example, if there 
is an error in the questionnaire design that negatively 
affects the accurate capture of respondents’ answers, 
processing errors are created. Systematic errors often 
lead to a bias in the final results. Unlike sampling error 
and random error resulting from nonsampling error, 
bias caused by systematic errors cannot be reduced by 
increasing the sample size.

Coverage error occurs when a housing unit or person 
does not have a chance of selection in the sample 
(undercoverage), or when a housing unit or person has 
more than one chance of selection in the sample or 
is included in the sample when they should not have 
been (overcoverage). For example, if the frame used 

for the ACS did not allow the selection of newly-con-
structed housing units; the estimates would suffer from 
errors because of housing undercoverage.

The final ACS estimates are adjusted for undercover-
age and overcoverage by controlling county-level 
estimates to independent total housing unit controls 
and to independent population controls by sex, age, 
race, and Hispanic origin, produced by the Census 
Bureau’s Population Estimates Program. However, it is 
important to measure the extent of coverage adjust-
ment by comparing the precontrolled ACS estimates to 
the final controlled estimates. If the extent of coverage 
adjustments is large, there is a greater chance that dif-
ferences in characteristics of undercovered or overcov-
ered housing units or individuals differ from those eligi-
ble to be selected. When this occurs, the ACS may not 
provide an accurate picture of the population before 
the coverage adjustment, and the population controls 
may not eliminate or minimize that coverage error. For 
more information about coverage error visit the Census 
Bureau’s Coverage Rates Definitions Web page.74

However, the process of controlling ACS estimates to 
the official population estimates may lead to addi-
tional errors in the ACS data. The population controls 
used in the ACS are midyear, point-in-time population 
estimates based on the decennial census, which has 
different residence rules than the monthly samples 
on which ACS estimates are based. See the section 
on “Residence Rules and Reference Periods” for more 
information.

Unit nonresponse is the failure to obtain the minimum 
required information from a housing unit or a resident 
of group quarters in order for it to be considered a 
completed interview. Unit nonresponse means that no 
survey data are available for a particular sampled unit 
or person. For example, if no one in a sampled housing 
unit is available during the time frame for data collec-
tion, unit nonresponse will result. 

It is important to measure unit nonresponse because 
it has a direct effect on the quality of the data. If the 
unit nonresponse rate is high, it increases the chance 
that the final survey estimates may contain bias, even 
though the ACS estimation methodology includes a 
nonresponse adjustment intended to control potential 
unit nonresponse bias. This will happen if the charac-
teristics of nonresponding units differ from the char-
acteristics of responding units. For more information

Response Rates Definitions Web page.75

Item nonresponse occurs when a respondent fails 
to provide an answer to a required item or when the 
answer given is inconsistent with other information. 
With item nonresponse, while some responses to 
the survey questionnaire for the unit are provided, 
responses to other questions are not obtained. For 
example, a respondent may be unwilling to respond 
to a question about income, resulting in item 
nonresponse for that question. Another reason for 
item nonresponse may be a lack of understanding of a 
particular question by a respondent.

Information on item nonresponse allows users to judge 
the completeness of the data on which the survey 
estimates are based. Final estimates can be adversely 
impacted when item nonresponse is high, because 
bias can be introduced if the actual characteristics of 
the people who do not respond to a question differ 
from those people who do respond to it. The ACS 
estimation methodology includes imputations for item 
nonresponse, intended to reduce the potential for item 
nonresponse bias. For more information about item 
nonresponse, visit the Census Bureau’s Item Allocation 
Rates Definitions Web page.76

Response error occurs when data are reported or 
recorded incorrectly. Response errors may be due to 
the respondent, the interviewer, the questionnaire, or 
the survey process itself. For example, if an interviewer 
conducting a telephone interview incorrectly records 
a respondent’s answer, response error results. In the 
same way, if the respondent fails to provide a correct 
response to a question, response error results. Another 
potential source of response error is a survey process 
that allows proxy responses to be obtained, wherein a 
knowledgeable person within the household provides 
responses for another person within the household 
who is unavailable for the interview. Even more error 
prone is allowing neighbors to respond.

Processing error can occur during the preparation of 
the final data files. For example, errors may occur if 
data entry of questionnaire information is incomplete 
or inaccurate. Coding of responses incorrectly also 
results in processing error. Critical reviews of edits and 
tabulations by subject matter experts are conducted 
to keep errors of this kind to a minimum.

ACS Quality Measures

Nonsampling error is extremely difficult, if not impos-
sible, to measure directly. However, the Census Bureau 
has developed a number of indirect measures of 
nonsampling error to help inform users of the qual-
ity of the ACS estimates: sample size, coverage rates, 
unit response rates and nonresponse rates by reason, 
and item allocation rates. These measures are available 
on the Census Bureau’s Sample Size and Data Quality 
Web page.77

Sample size measures for the ACS summarize infor-
mation for the housing unit and group quarters (GQ) 
samples. The measures available at the state level are:78

•  Housing Units 

· Number of initial addresses selected. 
· Number of final survey interviews.

•  Group Quarters People (beginning with the 

2006 ACS) 
· Number of initial persons selected. 
· Number of final survey interviews.

Sample size measures may be useful in special cir-
cumstances when determining whether to use 1-year 
or 5-year estimates in conjunction with estimates of 
the population of interest. While the coefficient of 
variation (CV) can be used to determine usability, as 
explained in the section on “Understanding Error and 
Determining Statistical Significance,” there may be 
some situations where the CV is small but the user 
has reason to believe the sample size for a subgroup 
is very small and the robustness of the estimate is in 
question.

Coverage rates measure the ratio of ACS population 
or housing estimates of geographic areas or groups to 
the independent estimates for those areas or groups, 
multiplied by 100. National coverage rates are available 
for the total population by six race/ethnicity catego-
ries and the GQ population. Coverage rates are also 
available for housing units and total population by 
sex at both the state and national level. Low coverage 
rates are an indication of greater potential for cover-
age error in the estimates.   

Unit response and nonresponse rates for housing 
units are available at the county, state, and national

78 The sample size measures for housing units (number of initial 
addresses selected and number of final survey interviews) and for 
persons in group quarters cannot be used to calculate response rates. 
For the housing unit sample, the number of initial addresses selected 
includes addresses that were determined not to identify housing units, 
as well as initial addresses that are subsequently subsampled out in 
preparation for personal visit Nonresponse Followup. Similarly, the 
initial sample of people in group quarters represents the expected 
sample size within selected group quarters prior to visiting and sam-
pling of residents.

locate, no one home, temporarily absent, language 
problem, insufficient data, maximum contact attempts 
reached, and other.

A low unit response rate is an indication that there is 
potential for bias in the survey estimates.  

Missing data for a particular question or item is called 
item nonresponse. Item allocation involves the use of 
statistical procedures to impute the values for these 
missing data. Item allocation rates—the proportions of 
responses allocated for an item in a given geographic 
area—are determined by the content edits performed 
on the individual raw responses and closely corre-
spond to item nonresponse rates. Overall housing unit 
and person characteristic allocation rates are available 
at the state and national levels, which combine many 
different characteristics. Allocation rates for individual 
items are published at the state and national levels. 
Allocation rates for other summary levels may be cal-
culated from the B99 series of Detailed Tables in  
data.census.gov.

Item allocation rates differ by state, so data users are 
advised to examine the allocation rates for character-
istics of interest before drawing conclusions from the 
published estimates.

U.S. Census Bureau12. GLOSSARY

Accuracy. One of four key dimensions of survey qual-
ity. Accuracy refers to the difference between the sur-
vey estimate and the true (unknown) value. Attributes 
are measured in terms of sources of error (for example, 
coverage, sampling, nonresponse, measurement, and 
processing).

Allocation. A commonly used approach to imputation 
(a statistical procedure to fill in missing responses) is 
known as hot-deck allocation, which uses a statistical 
method to supply responses for missing or inconsis-
tent data from responding housing units or people in 
the sample who are similar. Certain values, such as a 
person’s educational attainment, are more accurate 
when provided from another housing unit or from a 
person with similar characteristics. Allocation rates 
measure the proportion of values that required hot-
deck allocation and are an important measure of data 
quality.

American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is a 
nationwide survey designed to provide communities a 
fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced 
the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter 
by collecting long-form type information throughout 
the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Full 
national implementation of the ACS began in 2005. 
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to 
obtain information about household residents and the 
housing unit itself.

The U.S. Census Bureau produces social, economic, 
housing, and demographic estimates from the ACS 
in the form of 1-year and 5-year estimates based on 
population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in 
estimating population and housing characteristics. It 
produces estimates for small areas, including census 
tracts and block groups and population subgroups.

Although the ACS provides population and hous-
ing unit estimates, the Census Bureau’s Population 
Estimates Program produces and disseminates the 
official estimates of the population for the nation, 
states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of 
housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and 
other decennial census years, the decennial census 
provides the official counts of population and housing 
units.

Application Programming Interface (API). API is a set 
of programs that allows an application to interact with 
other applications. The Census Bureau has developed 
the Census API, enabling developers to design Web 
and mobile apps to provide quick and easy access 
from sets of Census Bureau statistics.

Assignment. A type of imputation (a statistical proce-
dure to fill in missing responses), assignment involves 
looking at other data, as reported by the respondent, 
to fill in missing responses. For example, when deter-
mining sex, if a person reports giving birth to children 
in the past 12 months, the Census Bureau verifies that 
the person is female. This approach also uses data as 
reported by other people in the household to fill in a 
blank or inconsistent field. For example, if the refer-
ence person is a U.S. citizen, a biological child with a 
blank response to citizenship is also assumed to be a 
citizen.

Block Group. A statistical subdivision of a census tract, 
generally defined to contain between 600 and 3,000 
people and between 240 and 1,200 housing units, and 
the smallest geographic unit for which the Census 
Bureau tabulates sample data. A subdivision of a cen-
sus tract (or, before 2000, a block numbering area), 
a block group is a cluster of blocks having the same 
first digit of their four-digit identifying number within a 
census tract.

Census Geography. A collective term referring to 
the types of geographic areas used by the Census 
Bureau in its data collection and tabulation opera-
tions. This Web page shows the geographic entities for 
which data are available from the ACS, which provides 
information down to the block group level.79

With connecting lines, the diagram in the “Geographic 
Hierarchy” section shows the hierarchical relationships 
between geographic types. For example, a line extends 
from states to counties because a state is comprised 
of many counties, and a county can never cross a state 
boundary. 

If no line joins two geographic types, then an absolute 
and predictable relationship does not exist between 
them. For example, many places do not cross a county 
boundary (that is, only one county). However, some 
places extend over more than one county like New 
York City. Therefore, an absolute hierarchical relation-
ship does not exist between counties and places, and 
any tabulation involving both of these geographic 
types may represent only a part of one county or one 
place.

Census Tract. A small, relatively permanent statistical 
subdivision of a county delineated by a local commit-
tee of census data users for presenting data. Census 
tracts nest within counties and their boundaries 
normally follow visible features, but may follow legal 
geography boundaries and other nonvisible features

4,000 people and 1,600 housing units.

Coefficient of Variation (CV). The ratio of the standard 
error (square root of the variance) to the value being 
estimated, usually expressed in terms of a percentage 
(also known as the relative standard deviation). The 
lower the CV, the higher the relative reliability of the 
estimate.

Current Residence. The ACS uses a “current resi-
dence” concept to determine who should be consid-
ered a resident of a sample household. Everyone who 
is currently living or staying at a sample address is 
considered a resident of that address, except people 
staying there for 2 months or less. People who have 
established residence at the sample unit and are away 
for only a short period of time are also considered to 
be current residents. 

Comparison Profiles (CP). The Comparison Profiles 
show ACS data side-by-side from different data 
releases, indicating where there is a statistically sig-
nificant difference between estimates. Comparison 
Profiles are currently available for 1-year estimates 
and 5-year estimates starting with the release of the 
2011–2015 ACS 5-year data. The 5-year Comparison 
Profiles will compare data between two nonoverlap-
ping 5-year periods. ACS Comparison Profiles begin 
with the letters “CP.”

Confidence Interval. The sample estimate and its mar-
gin of error permit the construction of a confidence 
interval that represents the degree of uncertainty 
about the estimate. A 90 percent confidence interval 
can be constructed by adding and subtracting the 
published margin of error from the ACS estimate. A 90 
percent confidence interval can be interpreted roughly 
as providing 90 percent certainty that the true number 
falls between the upper and lower bounds.

Confidentiality. The guarantee made by law (Title 13, 
U.S. Code) to individuals who provide census infor-
mation regarding nondisclosure of that information 
to others. By law, the Census Bureau cannot disclose 
any private information that identifies a person or a 
business. Under federal law, the penalty for unlawful 
disclosure is a federal prison sentence of up to 5 years, 
a fine of up to $250,000, or both.

Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI program of the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics produces monthly data on 
changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a 
representative basket of goods and services.

Custom Tabulations. The Census Bureau offers a wide 
variety of general purpose data products from the ACS. 
These products are designed to meet the needs of the 
majority of data users and contain predefined sets of 
data for standard census geographic areas, including 
both political and statistical geographic areas. These 
products are available through data.census.gov and the 
ACS Web site. 

For users with data needs not met through the general 
purpose products, the Census Bureau offers Custom 
Tables on a cost-reimbursable basis, through the ACS 
Custom Tabulation program.80 Custom tables are cre-
ated by tabulating data from ACS microdata files. They 
vary in size, complexity, and cost depending on the 
needs of the sponsoring client.

Data.census.gov. The Census Bureau’s primary tool 
for accessing population, housing, and economic data 
from the ACS, the Puerto Rico Community Survey, the 
decennial census, and many other Census Bureau data 
sets. Data.census.gov provides access to ACS data for 
a wide range of geographic areas, including states, cit-
ies, counties, census tracts, and block groups.

Data Profiles (DP). Data Profiles provide summaries 
of ACS data for various social, economic, housing, and 
demographic characteristics for the United States, 
regions, divisions, states, counties, county subdivi-
sions, places, metropolitan areas, American Indian 
and Alaska Native areas, and other geographic areas. 
These profiles are similar in content to the demo-
graphic profiles from the decennial censuses. ACS 
Data Profiles begin with the letters “DP.” 

Controls. During the ACS weighting process, the offi-
cial county-level population and housing unit estimates 
are used as controls. Weights are adjusted so that ACS 
estimates conform to these controls (but do not nec-
essarily exactly match). This is done to improve person 
and housing unit coverage and to reduce the variabil-
ity of the ACS estimates.

Decennial Census. The census of population and 
housing, taken by the Census Bureau in years ending 
in 0 (zero). Article I of the Constitution requires that 
a census be taken every 10 years for the purpose of 
reapportioning the U.S. House of Representatives. Title 
13 of the U.S. Code provides the authorization for con-
ducting the census in Puerto Rico and the Island Areas.

Certain published estimates, such as total population 
estimates for states, do exactly match the controls. 
These estimates, which have five asterisks (*****) in 
the Margin of Error column in data.census.gov, are 
by definition fixed, and can be considered to have no 
sampling error.

Derived Estimates. One of the benefits of working 
with ACS data is the ability to develop unique esti-
mates called derived estimates. These derived esti-
mates are usually based on aggregating estimates

U.S. Census Bureauacross geographic areas or population subgroups 
for which combined estimates are not published in 
data.census.gov tables (e.g., aggregate estimates 
for a three-county area or for four age groups not 
collapsed).

Detailed Tables. Detailed Tables provide access to the 
most comprehensive ACS data tables on all topics and 
geographic areas. Tables include totals and subtotals. 
Users may choose more than one geographic area and 
more than one table that display in a scrolling list, but 
only what displays on the width of the screen will print.

ACS Detailed Tables begin with the letters “B” for base 
tables and “C” for collapsed tables. The “collapsed” 
tables cover the same topics as the base table, but 
with fewer categories.

Disclosure Avoidance. Statistical methods used before 
releasing data products to ensure the confidentiality of 
responses. 

Estimates. Data for the ACS are collected from a 
sample of housing units and used to produce estimates 
of the actual figures that would have been obtained 
by interviewing the entire population using the same 
methodology.

Five-Year Estimates. Estimates based on 5 years 
of ACS data. These estimates are meant to reflect the 
characteristics of a geographic area over the entire 
5-year period. These estimates are published for geo-
graphic areas down to the census block group level. 

File Transfer Protocol (FTP). A process that allows a 
user to download large census and survey files and 
data sets from the Census Bureau’s Web site.81

Geographic Comparison Tables (GCT). Allow users 
to compare ACS data across geographic areas in 
the same table (e.g., all counties in a state). ACS 
Geographic Comparison Tables begin with the letters 
“GCT.”

Group Quarters (GQ) Facilities. A GQ facility is a place 
where people live or stay that is normally owned or 
managed by an entity or organization providing hous-
ing and/or services for the residents. These services 
may include custodial or medical care, as well as other 
types of assistance. Residency is commonly restricted 
to those receiving these services. People living in GQ 
facilities are usually not related to one another. The 
ACS collects data from people living in both housing 
units and GQ facilities.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol), <www.census.gov/programs-surveys 
/acs/data/data-via-ftp.html>.

Group Quarters (GQ) Population. Includes all people 
living in group quarters instead of housing units. Group 
quarters are places where people live or stay, in a 
group living arrangement that is owned or managed by 
an entity or organization providing housing and/or ser-
vices for the residents. The group quarters population 
lives in group quarters, of which there are two general 
categories:

Institutional group quarters are facilities that house 
those who are primarily ineligible, unable, or unlikely 
to participate in the labor force while resident. The 
institutionalized population is the population resid-
ing in institutional group quarters, such as adult cor-
rectional facilities, juvenile facilities, skilled-nursing 
facilities, and other institutional facilities such as 
mental (psychiatric) hospitals and in-patient hospice 
facilities.

Noninstitutional group quarters are facilities that 
house those who are primarily eligible, able, or likely 
to participate in the labor force while resident. The 
noninstitutionalized population lives in noninsti-
tutional group quarters such as college/university 
student housing, military quarters, and other non-
institutional group quarters such as emergency 
and transitional shelters for people experiencing 
homelessness and group homes.

Housing Unit. A housing unit is a house, an apartment, 
a mobile home or trailer, a group of rooms, or a single 
room occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, 
intended for occupancy as separate living quarters. 
Separate living quarters are those in which the occu-
pants live separately from any other individuals in the 
building and which have direct access from outside 
the building or through a common hall. For vacant 
units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are 
applied to the intended occupants whenever possible.

Imputation. When data are missing, it is standard prac-
tice to use a statistical procedure called imputation to 
fill in missing responses. Imputation is the placement 
of one or more estimated answers into a field of data 
records that previously had no data or had incorrect 
or implausible data. There are two principal imputation 
methods to deal with missing or inconsistent data—
assignment and allocation.

Margin of Error (MOE). The margin of error is the 
measure of sampling error published with each ACS 
estimate. A margin of error is the difference between 
an estimate and its upper or lower confidence bounds. 
Confidence bounds can be created by adding the mar-
gin of error to the estimate (for an upper bound) and 
subtracting the margin of error from the estimate (for 
a lower bound). All published margins of error for the 
ACS are based on a 90 percent confidence level.

80   What All Data Users Need to Know

U.S. Census BureauMeasurement Error. Also referred to as “response 
error,” measurement error occurs when the response 
received differs from the “true” value as a result of 
the respondent, the interviewer, the questionnaire, the 
mode of collection, the respondent’s record-keeping 
system(s), or other similar factors.

Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA). A statistical area 
defined to contain a population of 100,000 or greater 
for which the Census Bureau tabulates Public Use 
Microdata Sample (PUMS) data. ACS and decennial 
census population and housing microdata are dissemi-
nated using these defined areas.

Multiyear Estimates. Three-year and five-year esti-
mates based on multiple years of ACS data. ACS 
5-year estimates are published for geographic areas 
down to the census block group level. ACS 3-year 
estimates have been discontinued, but are available for 
2013 and earlier years for geographic areas with popu-
lations of 20,000 or more.

Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) Files. 
Computerized files containing a sample of individual 
records of people and households that responded 
to the ACS (stripped of all identifying information). 
The PUMS files permit analysis of specific population 
groups and custom variables that are not available 
through other ACS data products.

Narrative Profiles. Narrative profiles are short, analytic 
reports derived from recent ACS 5-year estimates. 
Each narrative profile covers 15 different topic areas 
and provides text and bar charts to display highlights 
of selected social, economic, housing, and demo-
graphic estimates for a selected geographic area.

Nonsampling Error. Total survey error can be classified 
into two categories—sampling error and nonsampling 
error. Errors that occur during data collection (for 
example, nonresponse error, response error, and inter-
viewer error) or data capture fall under the category of 
nonsampling error.

Overcoverage. Overcoverage exists when housing 
units or people have more than one chance of selec-
tion in the sample, or are included in the sample when 
they should not have been.

Period Estimates. An estimate based on information 
collected over a period of time. For ACS estimates, the 
period is either 1 year or 5 years. ACS 3-year estimates 
have been discontinued, but are available for 2013 and 
earlier years for geographic areas with populations of 
20,000 or more.

Point-in-Time Estimates. An estimate based on one 
point in time. The decennial census long-form esti-
mates for the 2000 Census were based on information 
collected as of April 1, 2000.

Population Estimates Program. The Census Bureau’s 
Population Estimates Program (PEP) produces July 1 
estimates for years after the last published decennial 
census (2010), as well as for past decades. Existing 
data series—such as births, deaths, federal tax returns, 
Medicare enrollment, and immigration—are used to 
update the decennial census base counts. Population 
estimates are used in federal funding allocations, in 
setting the levels of national surveys, and in monitoring 
recent demographic changes.

Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS). The counter-
part to the ACS that is conducted in Puerto Rico.

Quality Measures. Statistics that provide informa-
tion about the quality of the data from the ACS. Four 
different measures are provided with the annual data 
release: 1) initial sample size and final interviews, 2) 
coverage rates, 3) response rates, and 4) item allo-
cation rates for all collected variables. Details are 
available in the technical documentation for the ACS 
products.

QuickFacts. A Census Bureau Web site that provides 
quick, easy access to facts about people, businesses, 
and geographic areas for all states, counties, and cities 
and towns with more than 5,000 people.

Ranking Tables. A table or product type that orders 
the states according to the numeric value of the data 
displayed. ACS Ranking Tables begin with the letter “R.”

Reference Week. The calendar week preceding the 
date on which the respondents completed their ques-
tionnaires or were enumerated. This calendar week 
may not be the same for all people since the enumera-
tion may not be completed in 1 week.

Reference Period. Time interval to which survey 
responses refer. For example, many ACS questions 
refer to the day of the interview; others refer to “the 
past 12 months” or “last week.”

Residence Rules. The ACS uses a “current residence” 
rule to interview people who are currently living or 
staying in the sample housing unit as long as their stay 
at that address will exceed 2 months. See the entry 
on “Usual Residence” for information about residence 
rules in the decennial census.

Respondent. The person supplying survey or census 
information about his or her living quarters and its 
occupants.

Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data  81 
What All Data Users Need to Know  81

U.S. Census BureauRespondent Errors. The respondents’ failure to provide 
the correct answer to a survey question for any reason, 
such as poor comprehension of the question mean-
ing, low motivation to answer the question, inability to 
retrieve the necessary information, or an unwillingness 
to answer the question truthfully.

Sample. Entities selected for a specific survey.

Statistical significance in census data products is usu-
ally reported at the 90 percent confidence level.

Note that some statistical significance results displayed 
in data.census.gov may be based on unrounded esti-
mates and standard errors and users may not be able 
to duplicate the results using the rounded estimates 
and measures of error as displayed in data.census.gov.

Sample Data. Population and housing information col-
lected on a continuous basis for selected areas in the 
ACS and other surveys where data are gathered from 
a selected group of respondents. No sample data were 
collected in the 2010 Census.

Subject Tables. Subject Tables include ACS data orga-
nized by subject area, providing an overview of the 
information that analysts most often receive requests 
for from data users. ACS Subject Tables begin with the 
letter “S.” 

Sample Survey. A data collection activity involving 
observations or questionnaires for a sample of a popu-
lation. These data are used to produce estimates for 
the entire population.

Sampling Error. Errors that occur because only part of 
the population is directly contacted. With any sample, 
differences are likely to exist between the character-
istics of the sampled population and the larger group 
from which the sample was chosen.

Sampling Rate. Proportion of the addresses in a 
geographic area, or residents of a GQ facility, who are 
selected for interview in a particular time period.

Sampling Variability. Variation that occurs by chance 
because a sample of the population is surveyed rather 
than the entire population. 

Selected Population Profiles. Selected Population 
Profiles can be used to show ACS data for a specific 
racial or ethnic group (for example, Alaska Natives), 
ancestry groups, or country of birth. 

Single-Year (1-Year) Estimates. Estimates based on 1 
year of ACS data. They are meant to reflect the charac-
teristics of a geographic area over an entire 12-month 
period. ACS 1-year estimates are published for geo-
graphic areas with populations of 65,000 or more. 
Starting with the 2014 ACS, the Census Bureau is also 
publishing 1-year Supplemental Estimates—simplified 
versions of popular ACS tables for areas with at least 
20,000 people.

Standard Error. The standard error is a measure of the 
deviation of a sample estimate from the average of all 
possible samples. 

Statistical Significance, Test of. A test of statistical 
significance provides statistical evidence that indicates 
whether an observed difference between two esti-
mates is likely due to chance (“not statistically signifi-
cant”), or likely represents a true difference that exists 
in the population as a whole (“statistically significant”).

Summary File. The ACS Summary File is a comma-
delimited text file that contains all of the Detailed 
Tables for the ACS data releases. 

Summary Level. Summary levels specify the content 
and hierarchical relationships of the geographic ele-
ments that are required to tabulate and summarize 
data. Each summary level has an assigned 3-digit sum-
mary level code to help programmers link each specific 
summary level to its appropriate use in a table, map, or 
other data summarization format. Some examples of 
summary levels are:

•  040: State
•  050: State-County
•  060: State-County-County Subdivision
• 
• 
•  314: Metropolitan Statistical Area-Metropolitan 

150: State-County-Census Tract-Block Group
160: State-Place

Division

•  430: Urban Area-State-County

It is important to distinguish between a summary level 
and a geographic area. A summary level represents the 
concept of a geographic level. For example, summary 
level 050, State-County, represents the concept of a 
county within a state. By comparison, a geographic 
area covers territory “on the ground,” such as Madison 
County, Indiana.

Supplemental Estimates. Simplified Detailed Tables 
that provide access to the most recent ACS data at a 
lower population threshold than the standard 1-year 
tables. Available for selected geographic areas with 
20,000 people or more. ACS Supplemental Estimates 
begin with the letter “K.”

Undercoverage. The extent to which a sample does 
not include members of the target population thus 
preventing those members from having any chance of 
selection into the sample.

Unit Nonresponse. The failure to obtain the minimum 
required data from a unit in the sample.

82   Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data 
82   What All Data Users Need to Know

U.S. Census BureauUniverse. The total number of units (e.g., individu-
als, households, or businesses) in the population of 
interest.

Usual Residence. Usual residence is a concept used 
in the decennial census to determine where a person 
should be counted in the census. Usual residence is 
defined as the place where a person lives and sleeps 
most of the time. This place is not necessarily the same 
as a person’s voting residence or legal residence.

Variance Replicate Tables. These augmented ACS 
Detailed Tables include sets of 80 replicate estimates, 
which allow advanced users to calculate measures 
of error for estimates using the same methods that 
are used to produce the published margins of error 
(MOEs) in data.census.gov. These methods incorporate 
the covariance between estimates that approximate 
MOE formulas do not. They are published for a subset 
of the 5-year Detailed Tables and at selected summary 
levels. The 2010–2014 ACS 5-year estimates were the 
first for which these were available. We started by 
selecting “Block Group,” then “Louisiana,” “Orleans 
Parish, Louisiana,” and “All Block Groups within 
Orleans Parish, Louisiana” (see Figure 6.2).
