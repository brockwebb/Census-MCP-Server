We ask questions about age and date of birth to understand

the size and characteristics of different age groups and to

present other data by age.

Local, state, tribal, and federal agencies use age data to plan

and fund government programs that provide assistance or

services for speciﬁc age groups, such as children, working-age

adults, women of childbearing age, or the older population.

These statistics also help enforce laws, regulations, and

policies against age discrimination in government programs

and in society.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci

and law enforcement.

Question as it appears on the form

We ask one question that covers age and date of birth to understand the characteristics of
different age groups.

Age and date of birth data help communities:

Provide Assistance to Older Americans

We ask about age to help local ofﬁcials provide programs and services for adults aged 60 and older to:

Remain living safely in their homes and communities (Older Americans Act).
Receive services and assistance, such as financial assistance with utilities (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program).

Provide Assistance to Children and Families

We ask about the number and age of children in families, health insurance status, and income to help communities enroll eligible

families in programs designed to assist them such as:

Medicaid
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)

Educate Children and Adults

School districts make long-term building, stafﬁng, and funding decisions based on how many children and adults depend on thei

services. We ask about age, disability status, language spoken at home, and income to assist schools in understanding the need
of their students and qualify them for grants that help fund student programs (Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965)

Ensure Equal Opportunity

We ask about age, housing, employment, and education to help government and communities enforce laws, regulations, and

policies against discrimination based on age. For example, age information is used to analyze the employment status of workers

by age (Age Discrimination in Employment Act).

History of age question

The age question originated with the 1790 Census. It was added to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the decennial
census long form.
