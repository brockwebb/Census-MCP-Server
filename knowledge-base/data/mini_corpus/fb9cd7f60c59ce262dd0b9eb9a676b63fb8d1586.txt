We ask questions about the computers and devices that people

use, whether people access the internet, and how people

access the internet to create data about computer and internet

use.

We added these questions in 2013 as a requirement of the

Broadband Data Improvement Act of 2008. They help federal

agencies measure the nationwide development of broadband

access and decrease barriers to broadband access.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci

and law enforcement.

Questions as they appear on the form

We ask three questions that cover the type of computer you use, whether you have internet
access, and what type of internet access you have.

Computer and internet use data help communities:

Ensure Residents Can Communicate

We ask about computer and internet use to help state and local agencies evaluate access to broadband in their communities.

Schools, libraries, rural health care providers, and other public service providers also use this information. Communities ensure

their residents are connected to assistance programs, emergency services, and important information. These statistics are usefu

to understand whether to use internet or more expensive outreach methods for distributing important public health or safety

information.

Federal agencies use these data to evaluate the extent of access to, and adoption of broadband, with a focus on underserved

areas.

History of computer and internet use questions

Computer and internet use questions were added to the ACS in 2013 and modiﬁed in 2016. Research about this modiﬁcation
