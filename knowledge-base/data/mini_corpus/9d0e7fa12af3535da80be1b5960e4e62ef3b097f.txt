Comparing 2010 American Community Survey 1-Year 
Estimates of Occupancy Status, Vacancy Status, and 
Household Size with the 2010 Census - Preliminary 
Results  

12/20/11 

OBJECTIVE 
The 2010 Census and the American Community Survey (ACS) both measure occupancy status, vacancy 
status, and household size.  This report will:  

(1)  document comparisons of published information on these measures from the 2010 ACS with the 

2010 Census  

(2)  discuss the design and methodology differences of  the ACS and the 2010 Census that likely  

contribute to the observed measurement differences   

We will highlight where differences exist and identify possible explanations for the differences.  These 
differences do not necessarily imply errors exist in either the ACS or the 2010 Census results.  To the 
extent interviewers and enumerators misclassified housing units, this report will not try to determine if 
the ACS or the Census was more correct.   

BACKGROUND 
Both  the  decennial  census  and  the  ACS  provide  information  to  meet  the  nation’s  legal  and 
programmatic  needs.    The  different  purposes  and  relative  sizes  of  these  two  data  collection  efforts 
guided the methodologies used to collect and process data. We expected these differences in methods 
could result in differences in the published results. 

The 2010 Census enumerated the nation’s entire population as required by the Constitution.  The results 
are  used  for  apportionment,  redistricting,  and  to  support  important  legislation.    Securing  a  complete 
count of the U.S. population is the primary goal of the decennial census and it is designed to produce 
this count and ensure key information can be produced by the legal deadlines.  While the 2010 Census 
benefitted  from  the  publicity  and  perceived  importance  of  a  decennial  census,  its  design  had  to 
accommodate  a  tremendous  workload  and  tight  operational  scheduling  constraints.  To  produce 
accurate  and  fair  census  counts,  a  single  reference  date  had  to  be  used.    The  2010  Census  results 
therefore attempt to describe the population and housing (including the vacancy rate) on April 1, 2010.   

The  Census  Bureau,  in meeting  its  Constitutional  mandate,  is  committed  to  achieving  a  complete 
enumeration.  Given this goal and the large number of temporary staff that must be hired to conduct 
the  enumeration,  the  Census  Bureau  has  chosen  to  use  special  coverage  improvement  procedures, 
including  a  follow  up  on  housing  units  classified  as  vacant.  The  Census  Bureau  has  found  these 
procedures  improve  both  the  completeness  of  the  housing  unit  inventory  and  the  count  of  the 
population.  

The  ACS  is  designed  to  collect  detailed  data  to  measure  the  nation’s  population  and  housing 
characteristics in a survey setting. The primary goal of the ACS is to provide survey estimates every year 
1 

 
 
instead of once a decade -- giving communities the current information they need between censuses to 
plan  investments  and  services.  Information  from  the  survey  helps  determine  how  to  distribute  more 
than $400 billion in federal and state  funds each year.   The  ACS estimates  the nation’s  characteristics 
over the course of a year, requiring responses be collected continuously with a floating reference date 
based  on  the  date  of  interview.    The  2010  ACS  1-year  estimates  therefore  describe  population  and 
housing characteristics (including vacancy rates) throughout calendar year 2010, not as of any specific 
day in 2010.   

Although  coverage  of  the  entire  population  is  critical  in  a  census,  many  additional  efforts  used  in  a 
census to improve coverage are impractical and cost prohibitive in a survey like the ACS.  The need for 
such procedures may also be less important in a survey setting with more experienced staff.   

INTRODUCTION 
The national-level differences in the 2010 ACS 1-year estimates of total occupied housing units and total 
vacant housing units relative to the 2010 Census are statistically significant.1  These differences resulted 
in  the  2010  ACS  1-year  gross  vacancy  rate  being  about  1.7  percentage  points  higher  than  the  gross 
vacancy rate of the 2010 Census.2  See Table 1 for a summary of these comparisons.

Every  year  the  Census  Bureau  uses  the  most  recent  housing  unit  and  population  estimates  from  the 
Population Estimates Program (PEP) as survey controls to improve the quality of the ACS estimates.3  In 
2010 the total housing unit and total population estimates from the PEP were based on the 2010 Census 
results.  Therefore, the 2010 ACS 1-year estimates of total housing units and total population are similar 
to  the  2010  Census  counts  of  total  housing  units  and  total  population.  However,  the  PEP  does  not 
provide estimates of total households so, unlike the estimate of total housing units, the proportion of 
ACS housing units classified as either occupied or vacant is determined by ACS survey interview results.   

1  Statistical  significance  means  that  there  is  statistical  evidence  that  a  true  difference  exists  within  the  full 
population, and that the observed difference is unlikely to have occurred by chance due to sampling.  All statistical 
tests in this paper use a 90 percent level of confidence. The numbers of occupied and vacant housing units from 
the 2010 Census are based on a complete enumeration and therefore they do not include any sampling error.  The 
2010 ACS estimates are based on a sample and any comparisons with the 2010 Census must therefore account for 
sampling variability in the ACS estimates.   
2 The gross vacancy rate is the proportion of the total housing inventory that is vacant.  
3  The  use  of  survey  controls  is  standard  practice  in  household  surveys  and  has  been  shown  to  reduce  sampling 
variability and improve survey coverage.  During the processing of the survey, the population and housing weights 
are adjusted so that they will sum to the survey control totals.

As  a  result  of  the  difference  in  vacant  housing  units,  a  corresponding  difference  of  slightly  over  2.1 
million fewer 2010 ACS occupied housing units or households exists.  The combined effect of fewer 2010 
ACS  total  households  and  similar  2010  ACS  estimated  total  population  means  the  2010  ACS  1-year 
estimate of average household size is greater than the 2010 Census average household size.   

Looking at vacant housing units by type of vacancy allows us to better understand these differences (see 
Table 2.)  Comparing 2010 ACS and 2010 Census types of vacant housing units shows, with the exception 
of vacant housing units classified as “for sale only,” all other differences between the 2010 Census and 
the 2010 ACS were statistically significant.  Note a large proportion of the vacant housing units in both 
the  2010  ACS  and  the  2010  Census  are  classified  as  “other  vacant”  or  “for  seasonal,  recreational,  or 
occasional use.” “Other vacant” units include all vacant housing units that are not “for sale or sold”, “for 
rent  or  rented”,  “for  migrant  workers”,  or  “for  seasonal,  recreational,  or  occasional  use."  Based  on 
interviewer debriefings most of these “other vacant housing units” are units neither for sale nor for rent.  
They may be recent foreclosures, housing units owners or renters have “walked away from”, or housing 
units where the owners have not yet determined if they plan to sell or rent. 

We  see  some of the  greatest differences  in  the seasonal and the “other” vacant  categories. The 2010 
ACS  estimated  approximately  0.5  million  more  seasonal,  recreational,  occasional-use  vacant  housing 
units and about 1.6 million more “other vacant” housing units than the 2010 Census.

METHODOLOGY AND SELECTED RESULTS 
We established a working group within the Census Bureau to determine the set of factors most likely to 
explain these observed differences.  To assess the scope and define the issue our initial review included 
a comparison of gross vacancy rates and vacancy status at state and sub-state levels.   

We found the national-level results do not hold for every state (see Figure 1.)  In some states the 2010 
ACS  and  the  2010  Census  gross  vacancy  rates  are  not  statistically  different,  while  in  other  states  the 
differences  are  statistically  significant  and  quite  large.    The  2010  ACS  and  2010  Census  gross  vacancy 
rate  differences  were  not  statistically  significant  in  Minnesota,  Vermont,  Iowa,  Utah,  Wisconsin, 
Nebraska,  North  Dakota,  and  New  Hampshire.    In  all  other  states  the  differences  were  statistically 
significant with some of the greatest observed differences in the District of Columbia, Florida, Delaware, 
Alabama, New Mexico, Mississippi, and Georgia.

Percentage Point Difference in Gross Vacancy Rate (ACS - Census) 

Figure 1.  Comparison of 2010 ACS 1-Year and 2010 Census Gross Vacancy Rates– State Level  

The national finding that these differences were driven by a greater number of “other vacants” holds for 
many states but this is not true in every state.  Alabama, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and the 
District of Columbia have some of the greatest differences in the percentages of housing units classified 
as “other vacant.”  Some of the largest differences in the percentages of “for seasonal, recreational, or 
occasional use” were observed in New Mexico, Florida, North Dakota, and Nevada.   

These results suggest different scenarios contribute to the 2010 ACS and the 2010 Census gross vacancy 
rate  differences.    Different  environments  for  interviewing  (e.g.,  challenges  in  seasonal  areas  and  in 
inner-city,  hard-to-count  areas)  could  also  influence  how  interviewers  and  enumerators  ultimately 
classify  a  housing  unit.    This  observed  variability  in  the  levels  and  types  of  differences  support  later 
findings that these differences do not appear to be due to systematic variations in how the ACS and the 
2010 Census defined occupied versus vacant housing units.  

Differences in gross vacancy rates are concentrated in the  South Region and in states with the lowest 
levels  of  mail  response  in  both  the  2010  ACS  and  the  2010  Census.    The  classifications  of  occupied 
housing  units  in  these  areas  rely  much  more  on  interviewers  and  enumerators  as  opposed  to  self 
response  which  tends  to  be  more  accurate.    The  “hardest-to-survey”  areas  tend  to  have  the  largest 
differences in gross vacancy rates between the ACS and the 2010 Census.

To  help  assess  if  the  2010  ACS  results  were  reasonable  we  conducted  a  demographic  analysis  of 
historical trends in vacancy rates from the ACS, the Census, and the Housing Vacancy Survey (HVS).  The 
HVS is the official source of information on vacant housing units and has been conducted since 1985 for 
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.4  Figure 2 compares the gross vacancy rates 
for these three different measures over the 1990 to 2010 period.   

Some consistent patterns are clear.  All measures (the ACS, HVS and Census) show an appreciable rise in 
the vacancy rate from 2000 to 2010. Figure 2 demonstrates the ACS gross vacancy rate was higher than 
the  Census  gross  vacancy rate  in  2000  (9.6  versus  9.0)  as well  as 2010  (13.1  versus  11.4),  though  the 
difference is wider in 2010.  Likewise, the ACS estimates are consistently below the HVS across the time 
series from 2000 to 2010. These systematic differences between the sets of estimates are attributable in 
large part to the way the ACS, HVS, and the Census interview occupied and vacant housing units.5

To  rule  out  the  possibility  that  2010  Census  and  ACS  staff  may  have  used  different  concepts  or 
definitions  when  classifying  housing  units  as  occupied  versus  vacant,  we  conducted  a  detailed  review 
and comparison of the written procedures and training materials provided to ACS field representatives 
and census enumerators.  We also conducted a structured set of debriefing calls with current ACS field 
representatives from four regional offices,  including staff who had worked on the 2010 Census.  While 
we identified a few minor issues and the need to clarify a few procedures, we concluded the  ACS and 
2010 Census definitions and methods used to determine if a housing unit was occupied versus vacant 
were essentially the same.  We expect to release a detailed summary of these findings in early 2012.

To  better  understand  if  specific  methods  used  in  the  2010  Census  and  the  2010  ACS  contributed  to 
these differences, we obtained summary data from 2010 Census operational assessments and accessed 
ACS  operational  data.    We  plan  to  issue  summaries  of  the  methods  and  findings  from  each  of  these 
assessments in early 2012. 

We reviewed the following 2010 Census operational assessments and research: 

1.  Results from the  2010 Census Nonresponse  Follow  up (NRFU) operation and the 2010  Census 
Vacant Delete Check (to assess if the conversion rates of vacant and deleted units to occupied 
units could be attributed to this coverage improvement operation). 

2.  2010 Census qualitative and ethnographic research (to better understand enumerator behavior 

during NRFU). 

3.  Tabulations of count imputation (to understand the possible impact of incomplete information 

on housing status, occupancy status, and household size). 

4.  Results from the 2010 Census duplicate study (to assess if some census occupied units could be 

duplicated households that moved between April 1st and when they were enumerated). 

We also reviewed or produced the following ACS operational data: 

1.  Gross vacancy rates by mode of data collection (to understand how often 2010 ACS vacant units 

were interviewed without an in-person visit).  

2.  Reinterview data (to assess the quality of vacant classifications by ACS field representatives). 
3.  Vacancy rates by month (sample panel) and by main versus supplemental sample (to assess the 
impact of ACS year round data collection and determine if vacancy rates increased over time). 
4.  Master  Address  File  changes  during the time  period  for selecting  the  main and  supplemental 
ACS samples and changes after ACS sample selection that reflect 2010 Census findings (to assess 
the differences in the 2010 Census and the 2010 ACS housing unit frames). 

5.  ACS  gross  vacancy  rates  at  various  stages  of  ACS  weighting  and  estimation  (to  assess  the 

possible effects of weighting on the estimates). 

We  also  conducted  a  detailed  match  study  comparing  the  specific  2010  Census  and  2010  ACS 
classifications for all 2010 ACS sample addresses.  We added operational data from the 2010 Census and 
the ACS to the match study results to identify the characteristics of the ACS and 2010 Census housing 
units  with  classification  differences.  This  analysis  includes  looking  at the mode  and  timing  of  ACS  and 
Census interviews.  In addition, this study allows us to identify the Local Census Offices (LCOs) with the 
greatest  differences  in  gross  vacancy  rates  along  with  some  LCO  characteristics  such  as  participation 
rates, proxy rates, and hard-to-count scores.  We also reviewed information on areas with high levels of 
seasonal (not year-round) housing.  We are producing detailed reports summarizing this research. 

FINDINGS 
We believe the following factors explain the 2010 ACS and the 2010 Census differences in occupied and 
vacant housing unit classifications.  We observed differences in 2000 ACS and Census 2000 occupancy 
status and some of the same factors identified in 2000 were likely contributors this decade as well (U.S. 
Census Bureau, 2004).

Different Reference Periods, Residence Rules, and Interview Periods 

Reference Periods 
The  2010  ACS  1-year  estimates  do  not  measure  characteristics  for  the  same  time  frame  as  the  2010 
Census.    Although  implementation  may  be  imperfect,  census  data  collection  procedures  direct 
enumerators  to  classify  the  vacant  status  of  addresses  as  of  April  1  and  not  as  of  the  day  they  are 
enumerated.  In contrast, the ACS conducts interviews throughout the year and directs interviewers to 
collect  information  based  on  the  day  each  sample  unit  is  interviewed.    The  ACS  reference  date  for 
occupancy  status  is  therefore  the  full  year  -  January  1,  2010  through  December  31,  2010.    When  the 
Census  Bureau  produces  annual  ACS  estimates  of  gross  vacancy,  they  describe  the  vacancy  rate 
throughout the full calendar year.  

In some parts of the country vacancy rates vary across the year and a vacancy rate as of April 1 may not 
be the same as an annual average vacancy rate.  We do not believe this difference in reference period 
was a major contributor to the overall gross vacancy rate difference.  The 2010 ACS gross vacancy rates 
measured throughout the year were stable.   

Residence Rules 
The  ACS  and  the  Census  impose  different  residence  rules  to  determine  if  a  specific  housing  unit  is 
occupied  or  vacant.  The  ACS  uses  a  concept  of  “current  residence”  given  the  monthly  samples 
distributed throughout the year, rather than the census concept of “usual residence” as of April 1st.  The 
ACS will classify a unit as occupied if someone staying in the unit has stayed or plans to stay there for 
more than two months. The 2010 Census classified a unit as occupied if it was a person’s usual place of 
residence, meaning the place where they live or stay most of the time.   

Unlike the Census, the ACS allows temporary residents to be interviewed. Therefore, housing units that 
are  correctly  classified  as  vacant  under  the  Census usual  residence  rule  may  be  correctly  classified  as 
occupied  in  the  ACS.    This  difference  in  residence  rules  was  expected  to  result  in  fewer  ACS  housing 
units  being  classified  as  vacant.    While  this  is  the  opposite  direction  of  the  observed  national-level 
difference,  we  did  find  evidence  that  areas  with  high  concentrations  of  seasonal  housing  were  more 
likely to have ACS gross vacancy rates that were similar to, or lower than, the 2010 Census. The different 
residence rules do not appear to explain the higher gross vacancy rates in other areas.  

Interview Periods 
The  ACS  and  the  2010  Census  interview  periods  can  also  influence  the  occupancy  classification  of  an 
address.   The  ACS  uses  a 3-month  interview  period for  all  sample  addresses.   In  the  first  two months 
attempts are made to collect data by mail and telephone with personal visit contact made in the third 
month.  Vacant housing units are almost always identified in this third month and therefore the address 
has  an  opportunity  to  change  status  between  month  1  and  month  3.    Theoretically  this  3-month 
interview  period  should  depress  the  true  vacancy  rate  (Fronczek  and  Savage,  1998.)    The  April  1st 
reference  date  should  eliminate  the  impact  of  an  interview  period  in  the  2010  Census.    However,  if 
census  enumerators  classify  units  as  of  the  date  of  interview,  rather  than  the  reference  date,  similar 
effects would be expected since nonresponse follow up for the census (when vacants are enumerated) 
occurs several months after Census Day. 

Problems  can  arise  when  implementing  reference  periods  and  residence  rules.  In  the  2010  Census, 
vacant  housing  units  were  enumerated  in  either  Nonresponse  Follow  up  or  the  Vacant  Delete  Check 
7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which was at least two months after census day.  This enumeration of the Census Day reference date 
can  make  the  classification  of  vacant  units  problematic,  especially  for  movers.    Interviewers  and 
respondents in both the ACS and the 2010 Census can also misunderstand or misapply residence rules 
and reference periods which can lead to errors in unit classification. 

Different Address Frames 
The address frame used to select the sample for the 2010 ACS differs in important ways from the 2010 
Census address frame. We did not draw the 2010 ACS sample from the list of 2010 Census addresses.  
The  ACS  sample  is  always  selected  from  the  most  up  to  date  information  about  the  housing  unit 
addresses across the nation at the time of sample selection.  The ACS selects a main sample of addresses 
each summer.  We supplement and adjust that sample early in the calendar year to reflect updates to 
the MAF.   

In  preparation  for  the  2010  Census  many  changes  were  made  to  the  address  list  in  2009  and  2010.  
Given the timing of many of those changes, the frame for the 2010 ACS did not reflect some the housing 
unit  addresses  that  were  added  to,  and  dropped  from,  the  2010  Census  frame.    For  example,  we 
selected  the  2010  ACS  main  sample  during  August  and  September  2009  while  2010  Census  address 
canvassing operations were still underway and the MAF did not reflect the results of the 2010 Census 
address  canvassing  operation.    This  was  the  address  frame  for  the  January  through  April  ACS  sample 
panels.    The  updated  frame  used  to  select  the  supplemental  sample  of  housing  unit  addresses  and 
adjust the main sample for deleted housing units was based on the MAF as of February 2010.  At that 
point  the  MAF  reflected  the  results  of  the  2010  Census  address  canvassing  operation.  Therefore  the 
address frame for the May through December sample panels was quite different.  None of the 2010 ACS 
sample panels benefitted from the full 2010 Census enumeration of housing units. 

In  addition,  by  design  the  ACS  does  not  include  some  2010  Census  categories  of  housing  units.  
Specifically, the ACS never includes transitory units at transitory locations such as tents and boats.  They 
are not a part of the address frame. However, if census enumerators found individuals at these locations 
they enumerated  these  transitory units  as occupied housing units.  Enumerators never classified  these 
locations as 2010 Census vacant housing units so their inclusion reduced the 2010 Census vacancy rate.6  

2010 Census Coverage Improvement Procedures  
To  ensure  a  complete  population  count,  the  2010  Census  included  special  methods  to  review  and 
confirm the status of housing units  initially  classified  as vacant.   We include  this review  in the  Census 
because  research  has  shown  some  level  of  misclassification  can  occur  in  these  initial  census 
enumerations that can be reduced given a second contact.  

In  pretests  conducted  prior  to  the  1970  Census,  the  Census  Bureau  found  occupied  housing  units 
incorrectly  classified  as  vacant  to  be  a  significant  factor  in  the  population  undercount  (U.S.  Census 
Bureau,  1974).    The  1970  Census  included  a  National  Vacancy  Check  for  a  sample  of  addresses  and 
detected a misclassification rate  of 11.4  percent among units initially  classified as nonseasonal vacant 
(U.S. Census Bureau, 1974).  Starting in the 1980 Census, a comprehensive review of all units classified 
as vacant was added as a coverage improvement mechanism. In 1980 this check converted about 10.1 
percent  of  initially  classified  vacant  units  to  occupied  units  and  found  that  after  all  coverage 

6 The number of occupied housing units resulting from transitory locations in the 2010 Census was very small.

improvement  efforts,  about  0.9  percent  of  all  occupied  housing  units  were  over  enumerated  (U.S. 
Census Bureau, 1985.)   

The 1990 and 2000 censuses used similar methods with similar findings – improvements in population 
coverage could be achieved with some added level of duplication, over enumeration.  Census evaluation 
studies each decade support the decision to include this follow up operation in the 2010 Census.   The 
2010 Census Vacant Delete Check reviewed the status of some housing units that had been classified as 
either  vacant  or  deletes  in  Nonresponse  Follow  up.   This  operation  converted about  6  percent  of  the 
housing units initially classified as vacant to occupied (Heimel et al, 2011).   

No equivalent review of the status of all ACS vacant housing units occurs although the ACS subjects a 
small sample of vacant interviews to a reinterview procedure.  We designed this reinterview operation 
to  monitor  interviewer  performance  and  identify  interviewers  who  may  need  additional  training.  In 
2010 this ACS reinterview found about 2 percent of the vacant housing unit classifications should have 
been  classified  as  either  occupied  housing  units,  temporarily  occupied  housing  units,  or  as 
noninterviews.     

Problems Finding Knowledgeable Respondents and Determining Occupancy 
Status 
The 2010 Census and ACS interviewers faced a difficult task. Despite common procedures, differences in 
interpretation of what is an occupied housing unit can occur, especially in hard to count areas and, in 
general,  in  areas  experiencing  large  numbers  of  foreclosures.    It  is  challenging  to  determine  the 
occupancy status of a unit in some areas when no household members can be contacted and neighbors 
are unwilling to provide information. Classifications can differ based on who can be contacted, what can 
be observed from outside the housing unit, the efforts and approaches taken to resolve cases, and the 
experience of interviewing staff in dealing with uncooperative households.   

These  challenges  can  also  lead  to  interviewer  errors  when  they  make  assumptions  based  on  limited 
information.  The ACS and the 2010 Census found similar numbers of housing units classified as “vacant 
for sale only.”  This may be the easiest type of vacant to identify.  In contrast, units classified as “other 
vacants” had large differences and tend to be the harder cases to resolve.  

We analyzed state-level data on 2010 Census mail participation rates and percentage point differences 
in  gross  vacancy  rates  (see  Figure  3.)  States  with  the  highest  2010  Census  mail  participation  rates 
(Wisconsin,  Minnesota,  and  Iowa)  had  some  of  the  lowest  differences  in  gross  vacancy  rates.  Future 
research will explore measures of respondent cooperation at lower geographic levels.   

Our focus groups with field representatives found that when no one was available to confirm the status 
of a unit, when after repeated efforts no one answered the door, and when no obvious clues existed to 
flag the case as occupied versus vacant, they had problems determining if a unit was occupied or vacant.  
As  noted  earlier,  in  many  instances  the  vacancy  status  of  “other  vacant”  was  associated  with 
foreclosures.  We believe the risk of inconsistent assessments increased when the occupancy status of a 
housing unit was not obvious and knowledgeable respondents were not available. 

This is not  a new problem.   This challenge  confronts every survey and census.  In her review of gross 
vacancy rates  in decennial censuses, Love  (2001) noted, “the vacant  housing unit count  is obviously a 
very volatile statistic - identifying places where no one is living has always been problematic.”

CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS 
At this time, despite observed differences, we have confidence in the information on occupancy status 
and vacancy status released from the 2010 Census and the 2010 ACS.  Our review to better understand 
those differences did not reveal any systematic errors or implementation issues.   While this document 
does not include the detailed methods or results used in our analysis, we are producing those reports 
and plan to release them over the next few months.  They will provide greater detail for data users with 
a keener interest in this issue.
