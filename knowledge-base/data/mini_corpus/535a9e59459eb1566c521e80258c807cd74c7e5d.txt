The 2000-2005 rates are for the comparable universe excluding the group quarters population, since that population was

added to the ACS in 2006.

2 

Major changes were made to the disability questions beginning with the 2008 ACS questionnaire. Comparisons of rates

between years 2008 or later and years 2007 or earlier should not be made for these characteristics.

3 

The effects of the pandemic on ACS activities in 2020 impacted the allocation rates. For more information, see the Analytic

Report [ https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2021/acs/2021_CensusBureau_01.html] . Additionally for 2020, a
small number of vacant housing unit addresses that had been originally coded as non-interviews were converted to vacant
units through a modeling process in order to improve ACS estimates. For more information, see the user note
[https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2021-05.html] .

(X) 

Some instances where no response to this question was required were incorrectly tallied as allocations, overstating the

true level of item allocation required. The incorrect rates have been removed.
