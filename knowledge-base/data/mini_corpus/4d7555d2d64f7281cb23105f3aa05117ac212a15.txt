Geography and the
American Community
Survey: What Data Users
Need to Know

February 2020

Geography plays an important role in
all U.S. Census Bureau activities by

providing the framework used to
collect and publish data, including

American Community Survey
(ACS) estimates. Data users employ
ACS data that are tabulated for a
variety of geographic areas
to produce detailed portraits and

maps of social, economic, housing,
and demographic characteristics of
America’s communities.

This guide provides an overview of
geographic areas for which ACS data
are available, special considerations

in working with spatial data,
and links to tools and other
resources that data users can use to
map ACS data.
