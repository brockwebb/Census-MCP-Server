INTRODUCTION1

Parental leave in the United States is shaped by a 
combination of federal protections like the unpaid 
leave provided by the Family and Medical Leave 
Act (FMLA) and employer-specific policies that 
may offer paid or unpaid parental leave benefits.2 
Previous research has documented disparities in 
access to paid and unpaid parental leave across 
different occupations, racial and ethnic groups, and 
educational levels, suggesting that leave access 
may be limited across several demographic groups.3, 
4 Despite these trends, few studies have examined 
parental leave on a national scale, particularly 
in relation to the types of leave taken and work 
behaviors of parents surrounding their first-born 
child.

This report examines various parental leave and 
employment patterns for the nation using the  
U.S. Census Bureau’s 2022 Survey of Income and

ABOUT THE SIPP

The Survey of Income and Program Participation 
(SIPP) is a nationally representative, longitudinal 
survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau 
that provides comprehensive information on the 
dynamics of income, employment, household 
composition, and government program partici-
pation. The SIPP is also a leading source of data 
on economic well-being, family dynamics, edu-
cation, wealth, health insurance, child care, and 
food security. The SIPP interviews individuals for 
several years and provides monthly data about 
changes in household and family composition 
and economic circumstances over time. Visit the 
SIPP website at <www.census.gov/sipp> for more 
information.

Program Participation (SIPP).5 A 2011 report examining 
parental leave measures using SIPP data highlighted 
employment patterns and leave usage among first-
time mothers.6 Compared to the 2011 report, which 
focused solely on first-time mothers, this report 
provides insights on how work behaviors and leave 
arrangements differ by sex, with estimates for both 
first-time mothers and first-time fathers. 

5 The estimates in this report are weighted and come from the 
2022 SIPP public-use file available at <www.census.gov/programs-
surveys/sipp/data/datasets/2022-data/2022.html>. For technical 
documentation and more information about SIPP data quality, visit the 
SIPP website’s Technical Documentation page at <www.census.gov/

This report provides an overview 
of parental leave and employment 
in the United States for parents 
who worked before and after 
the birth of their first biological 
child, by several demographic 
characteristics.

CHARACTERISTICS OF 
PARENTS WHO WORKED 
BEFORE THE BIRTH OF THEIR 
FIRST CHILD 

Figure 1 details the percentage 
of parents who worked before 
the birth of their first child by the 
year their first child was born. 
Prior to 1981, about 38 percent of 
mothers and roughly 77 percent 
of fathers worked before the birth 
of their first child. From 1986 to 
1990, 61.1 percent of mothers and 
77.7 percent of fathers worked 
during the pregnancy before 
their first birth. The percentage of 
mothers and fathers who worked 
before their first child was born 
remained relatively stable between 
1991 and 2010. The percentage of 
mothers who worked during the 
pregnancy of their first child was 
60.3 percent from 1991 to 1995, 

2 

59.3 percent from 1996 to 2000, 
61.4 percent from 2001 to 2005, 
and 59.7 percent from 2006 to 
2010.7 Similarly, the percentage 
of first-time fathers who worked 
prior to the birth of their first child 
was roughly 76 percent from 1991 
to 1995, 1996 to 2000, 2001 to 
2005, and 2006 to 2010.8 About 
62 percent of first-time mothers 
and roughly 81 percent of first-
time fathers worked leading up to 
their first birth from 2011 to 2015, 
which increased for fathers from 
the previous birth cohort (2006 
to 2010).9 From 2016 to 2020, 
about 69 percent of mothers and 
roughly 80 percent of fathers 
worked before their first child was 

7 The estimates of first-time mothers who 

worked during the pregnancy of their first 
child from 1991 to 1995 (60.3 percent), 1996 
to 2000 (59.3 percent), 2001 to 2005 (61.4 
percent), and 2006 to 2010 (59.7 percent) 
did not significantly differ.

8 The estimates of first-time fathers who 

worked during the pregnancy of their first 
child from 1991 to 1995 (76.6 percent), 1996 
to 2000 (75.8 percent), 2001 to 2005 (76.3 
percent), and 2006 to 2010 (75.9 percent) 
did not significantly differ.

born. By 2021 to 2022, roughly 78 
percent of mothers and about 81 
percent of fathers worked during 
the pregnancy leading to the birth 
of their first child.10 The percentage 
of mothers who worked when 
pregnant with their first child has 
increased in recent years, with a 
period of stability between 1986 to 
2015, reflecting the overall rise in 
women’s labor force participation.11

Figure 1 highlights the work 
behaviors of parents by birth 
cohort, while Table 1 examines 
work behaviors of parents across 
all years. Table 1 reports the 
percentages of parents who 
worked during the pregnancy 
or after the birth of their first 
child, categorized by various 
demographic characteristics. 

10 The estimates of mothers (77.6 percent) 

and fathers (81.2 percent) who worked 
during the pregnancy leading up to the birth 
of the first child in 2021 to 2022 did not 
significantly differ.

Estimates provided are for first-
time parents who worked before 
their first child was born and 
who were under the age of 65 in 
2022. All estimates for working 
after the birth of the first child 
are conditional on parents who 
worked before the birth of the first 
biological child. About 60 percent 
of mothers and roughly 78 percent 
of fathers reported working during 
the pregnancy leading to the birth 
of their first biological child.

A higher percentage of parents 
who were older at their first birth 
were employed before having 
their first child. Estimates for first-
time parents who were employed 
before their first child was born 
are grouped by the age at which 
their first birth occurred. The 
groups under the age of 18 and 
age 30 and over are highlighted 
due to significant differences in 
employment before first-time 
parenthood, while the middle 
age ranges, those aged 18 to 29, 
showed a consistent upward trend. 
About 3 in 4 mothers aged 30 and 
over at the time of first birth (73.9 
percent) worked leading up to the 
birth of the first child, compared 
to only 1 out of 4 mothers under 
the age of 18 (28 percent). About 
39 percent of first-time mothers 
aged 18 to 19 were employed 
before their first child was born, 
compared to 70.3 percent of first-
time mothers aged 25 to 29. The 
gap was smaller among fathers, as 
about 80 percent of fathers aged 
30 or over worked leading up the 
birth of their first child, compared 
to 60 percent of fathers who were 
under the age of 18. About 70 
percent of first-time fathers aged 
18 to 19 worked before their first 
child was born compared to 79.1 
percent of those aged 25 to 29. 
Overall, older parents were more 

RECENT CHANGES TO PARENTAL LEAVE DATA 
COLLECTION

Prior to 2014, the Survey of Income and Program Participation 
(SIPP) included a maternal leave section within the fertility module. 
This section included information on women’s employment history, 
work history, and maternity leave arrangements. Parental leave 
information was not collected from 2014 to 2018. In 2019, the 
parental leave questions were reintroduced to the SIPP, and were 
asked of both men and women for the first time. The question 
sequence for the 2022 SIPP was updated to collect information on 
parental leave more efficiently and accurately. Detailed information 
on the improvement of the parental leave question sequence is 
provided in the SIPP 2022 Data Users’ Guide at <www2.census.gov/
programs-surveys/sipp/tech-documentation/methodology/2022_
SIPP_Users_Guide_SEP23.pdf>. 

likely to work preceding the birth 
of the first child than younger 
parents.

Among the racial groups 
presented, about 64 percent of 
White mothers worked leading 
up to the birth of their first child, 
compared to 49.5 percent of Black 
alone mothers and 43.3 percent 
of Asian alone mothers.12 White 
alone fathers had a higher rate of 
working leading up to the birth 
of their first child (79.4 percent) 
compared to Black fathers (69.3 
percent) and Asian fathers (72.6 
percent).13 Examining differences in 
work behaviors by Hispanic origin, 
44.9 percent of Hispanic mothers 
worked during the pregnancy of 
their first child, compared to 64.2 
percent of non-Hispanic mothers.

Differences in work behaviors 
before the birth of a first child 
across racial and ethnic groups 
may be influenced by differences 

12 The estimates of Black alone mothers 

(49.5 percent) and Asian alone mothers 
(43.3 percent) who worked during the 
pregnancy were significantly different from 
each other.

in occupation and societal 
expectations. Some racial and 
ethnic groups are more likely to 
work in lower-wage occupations, 
limiting their access to benefits 
like paid parental leave and 
flexible work arrangements, which 
influences their work behaviors 
before the birth of a first child, 
while others in higher-paying 
jobs can maintain employment 
due to greater job flexibility 
or more comprehensive leave 
options surrounding childbirth.14, 
15, 16 Additionally, societal norms 
regarding roles and family 
responsibilities can influence these 
differences between mothers and 
fathers, with some groups placing

a higher emphasis on women’s 
roles as caregivers.17, 18

The following estimates examine 
work behaviors in relation to 
the timing of the first birth, 
considering whether parents 
worked before their first child 
was born, and whether the first 
birth occurred before, during, or 
after the parents’ first marriage. A 
lower percentage of never-married 
mothers were employed during the 
pregnancy before their first birth, 
compared to mothers who had a 
first birth within their first marriage 
or after their first marriage ended 
(50.9 percent, 65.7 percent, and 
71.3 percent, respectively).19, 20 
Men who fathered their first child 
before marrying were less likely 
to be working before the birth, 
compared to men whose first 
child was born during or after 
their first marriage (71.5 percent, 
80.9 percent, and 79.1 percent, 
respectively).21

CHARACTERISTICS OF 
PARENTS WHO WORKED 
AFTER THE BIRTH OF THEIR 
FIRST CHILD 

While there were notable 
differences in work patterns 
among demographic groups prior 
to the birth of their first child, 

17 I. Browne and J. Misra, “The Intersection 

of Gender and Race in the Labor 
Market,” Annual Review of Sociology, 29(1), 
pp. 487–513, 2003.

18 B. Mintz and D. H. Krymkowski, 
“The Intersection of Race/Ethnicity and 
Gender in Occupational Segregation: 
Changes Over Time in the Contemporary 
United States,” International Journal of 
Sociology 40(4), pp. 31–58, 2010.

19 The estimates of mothers who were 

employed during their first marriage (65.7 
percent) and mothers who were employed 
after their first marriage (71.3 percent) were 
significantly different from each other.

20 Never-married parents are included 
with those whose first birth was before their 
first marriage.

21 The estimates of fathers who were 
employed during their first marriage (80.9 
percent) and fathers who were employed 
after their first marriage (79.1 percent) were 
not significantly different from each other.

there were fewer variations in work 
behaviors among these groups 
after the child’s birth. Estimates 
for those who worked after their 
child’s birth are shown for parents 
who worked during the pregnancy 
of their first child. For example, the 
percentage of mothers under the 
age of 18 at the time of first birth 
who worked after the birth of their 
first child (84.2 percent) did not 
significantly differ from mothers 
aged 30 or over (86.8 percent). 
Likewise, there was no significant 
difference between fathers under 
the age of 18 at the time of first 
birth working after the birth of 
their first child (93.4 percent) 
compared to fathers aged 30 and 
over (97.4 percent).

The racial and ethnic differences 
observed in parents who worked 
before the birth of their first child 
shifted when examining those 
who worked after the birth. For all 
racial and ethnic groups (roughly 
between 81 and 89 percent), 
mothers employed during the 
pregnancy returned to the labor 
force after giving birth. Black 
alone mothers (88.5 percent) 
were more likely to return to 
work after the birth of their first 
child than White mothers (84.3 
percent). After the birth of their 
first child, non-Hispanic mothers 
(85.7 percent) were more likely to 
work than Hispanic mothers (80.9 
percent). Nearly all Black alone, 
White alone, and Hispanic fathers 
worked after the birth of their first 
child (98.1 percent, 97.1 percent, 
and 96.0 percent, respectively).22 
Statistically, non-Hispanic fathers 
(97.3 percent) had a higher rate of 
working after the birth of their first 
child than Hispanic fathers (about 

96 percent). Rates of working after 
birth were more than 95 percent 
among first-time fathers across 
racial and ethnic groups.

There were few differences in work 
participation by education level 
among parents after the birth of 
their first child. Roughly 83 percent 
of mothers with less than a high 
school education and 86.9 percent 
of mothers with a bachelor’s 
degree or higher reported working 
after the first birth, although these 
estimates did not significantly 
differ. However, among fathers, 
the corresponding percentage 
that worked after the birth of 
their first child did significantly 
differ between fathers with less 
than a high school education 
(95.5 percent) and fathers with a 
bachelor’s degree or higher (97.9 
percent).

LEAVE ARRANGEMENTS USED 
BY PARENTS BEFORE AND 
AFTER THE BIRTH OF THEIR 
FIRST CHILD

Figure 2 presents the percentage 
of parents using selected leave 
arrangements after their first birth, 
categorized by cohorts of the first 
child’s birth year. Examining leave 
types taken by parents by birth 
cohort is particularly important 
due to the changing nature 
of policies surrounding leave. 
For example, the FMLA, which 
provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid 
leave to eligible workers, was 
signed into law in 1993.23

For first-time mothers, paid leave 
usage has increased for first 
children born after 2004, with a 
period of stability for those born 
prior 1994 and between 1994 

22 The estimates of Black alone (98.1 
percent) and Hispanic alone (96 percent) 
fathers were not significantly different 
from White alone fathers (97.1 percent), but 
Black alone and Hispanic alone fathers did 
significantly differ.

23 The Family and Medical Leave Act 
of 1993 was signed into law on February 
5, 1993, and came into effect on August 5, 
1993. The years of first birth cohorts were 
established to investigate any association 
between unpaid leave usage after the law 
was enacted.

and 2003, while an increasing 
percentage of first-time fathers 
reported taking a form of paid 
leave. Among mothers who gave 
birth for the first time before 1994, 
39.9 percent used a form of paid 
leave, whereas 42.8 percent of 
mothers with a first child born 
between 1994 to 2003, and 43.8 
percent of mothers who had a first 
birth between 2004 to 2013, used 
a form of paid leave after their 
child was born.24 During the 2014 
to 2022 birth cohort, about 49 
percent of first-time mothers used 
a form of paid leave.

First-time fathers experienced 
increases in the use of paid leave 
across birth cohorts. Prior to 1994, 
about 18 percent of fathers used a 
form of paid leave, which increased 
to 27.1 percent among fathers who 
had a first-born child between 
1994 to 2003. First-time fathers

percent paid leave rate after their 
first child was born, compared to 
50.1 percent of fathers who had a 
first-born child between 2014 and 
2022. Among parents who had a 
first-born child between 2014 to 
2022, there were no differences in 
the usage of paid leave between 
mothers (49.1 percent) and fathers 
(50.1 percent).

The trends in paid leave rates 
among parents suggest an 
association between occupational 
disparities, changing parental 
roles, and workplace policies. 
Mothers’ paid leave rates after the 
birth of their first child may be 
possibly due to their prevalence 
in lower-wage jobs with fewer 
benefits.25, 26 In contrast, the

increase in paid leave rates among 
fathers could be associated with 
more generous benefits in higher-
paying positions and evolving 
social norms that promote greater 
paternal involvement.27, 28

Prior to 1994, 25.4 percent of 
mothers took a form of unpaid 
leave. Mothers with a first birth 
from 1994 to 2003 had a similar 
likelihood of taking a form of 
unpaid leave (23.8 percent) 
compared to mothers with a first 
child born between 2004 to 2013 
(24.3 percent).29 About 6 percent 
of fathers with a first-born child 
between 1994 to 2003 took a form 
of unpaid leave, compared to 3.3 
percent of fathers with a first-born

child prior to 1994. The rates of 
unpaid leave taken after the birth 
of a first child were 7.0 percent 
between 2004 to 2014 and 12.6 
percent between 2014 to 2022 
among first-time fathers. In the 
most recent birth cohort (2014 to 
2022), a higher percentage of first-
time mothers (27.3 percent) than 
first-time fathers (12.6 percent) 
took a form of unpaid leave after 
their child was born.

The stability in unpaid leave rates 
for mothers, alongside a slight 
increase for fathers, may also be 
attributed to the fact that the 
FMLA only mandates unpaid 
leave, which limits its effect on 
overall leave-taking. Previous 
research found that while recent 
FMLA legislation increased the 
availability of leave, the lack of pay 
associated with FMLA provisions 
constrains its usage.30 Similarly, 
the financial burden of unpaid 
leave may prevent changes in 
leave patterns for parents.31, 32 
Consequently, despite the legal 
framework supporting leave, the 
rate of unpaid leave has not seen 
substantial increases.

Circumstances leading to time 
away from work, such as quitting 
or being let go, are considered 
leave arrangements in this report. 
Some parents use only one type 
of leave arrangement, while others 
may combine multiple types. A 
considerable portion of mothers

quit or were let go from their job 
after their child was born. Prior 
to 1994, 15.5 percent of mothers 
reported quitting their job or being 
let go after their first child was 
born. About 14 percent of mothers 
between 1994 to 2003 and 2004 
to 2013 reported leaving their job 
or being let go after the birth of 
their first child. About 12 percent of 
mothers whose first child was born 
between 2014 to 2022 reported 
being let go or quitting their job 
after their child was born.33 

Rates for quitting or being let 
go from a job for fathers were 
relatively low across all birth 
cohorts.

The moderate portion of mothers 
who quit their job or were let go 
from their jobs around the time 
of their first child’s birth may 
be due to insufficient parental 
leave policies, lack of workplace 
flexibility, and the financial 
burden of child care.34 Insufficient 
maternity leave provisions and the 
absence of job protection may 
increase the likelihood of mothers 
exiting the workforce, which forces 
many mothers to choose between 
returning to work prematurely or 
quitting altogether.35 High child 
care costs also contribute to this 
issue, as the expense of child care 
often exceeds potential earnings, 
making it more practical for many 
mothers to leave the workforce.36

33 The estimates for mothers who quit or 
were let go did not significantly differ across 
birth cohorts.

The patterns of leave-taking vary 
between mothers and fathers 
who do not take leave. About 16 
percent of mothers who had a first 
birth prior to 1994 and from 1994 
to 2003 did not take any leave 
after their child was born.37 For 
mothers with a first birth between 
2004 and 2013, 14.7 percent did 
not take leave. For the 2014 to 
2022 birth cohort, 11.3 percent of 
mothers did not take any type 
of leave after their first child was 
born.38 

The percentage of fathers who do 
not take leave has been decreasing 
over time, with 77.0 percent of 
fathers reporting not taking leave 
prior to 1994, compared to 65.1 
percent with a first birth between 
1994 to 2003. In the 2004 to 2013 
cohort, more than half of fathers 
did not take any leave after their 
first child was born (54.2 percent). 
More recently, about 35 percent of 
the fathers with a first child born 
between 2014 to 2022 did not take 
any leave.

A large share of fathers did not 
take any leave, which may be due 
in part to the lack of workplace 
flexibility, lack of a universal paid 
parental leave policy, or traditional 
social norms. Studies indicate that 
some fathers may face stigma 
or negative career repercussions 
if they take extended leave, 
resulting in low usage of paternity 
leave.39, 40 In addition, the lack 
of a universal paid leave policy 

37 The estimates of mothers who did 
not take leave prior to 1994 (16.4 percent) 
and 1994 to 2003 (15.9 percent) did not 
significantly differ.

38 The percentage of mothers who did 

not take leave was significantly different 
from 2004 to 2013 (14.7 percent) to 2014 to 
2022 (11.3 percent).

may cause financial concern, as 
fathers may be the primary income 
earner within households.41, 42 The 
increasing trend of paid leave for 
fathers across birth cohorts and 
the decreasing trend of fathers not 
taking any leave suggest that the 
workplace policies and parental 
leave policies may be more 
generous, and social norms that 
promote paternal involvement may 
be increasing for fathers.

Table 2 offers a detailed view 
of leave arrangements taken 
throughout all years when first-
time parents had a child. It is 
important to note that leave types 
are not mutually exclusive, since 
parents may use multiple leave 
arrangements. Estimates for leave 
arrangements taken before the 
first birth are shown for parents 
who worked leading up to the 
birth of the first child. Detailed 
leave arrangements taken after the 
first birth are shown for parents 
who worked during the pregnancy 
and after the birth of the first 
child.

The following section describes 
the types of leave taken by parents 
before and after their first child 
was born. The types of paid leave 
discussed include paid maternity 
or paternity leave, sick leave, and 
vacation leave. Unpaid types of 
leave taken by parents include 
unpaid maternity, unpaid paternity, 

and unpaid sick leave. Some 
parents might use other types of 
leave, such as disability leave, or 
they might decide to resign, face 
termination, or forgo taking leave 
altogether. These alternatives are 
also included in the discussion of 
leave options.

Both first-time mothers and first-
time fathers were more likely to 
utilize a form of leave after their 
child’s birth than before their 
child’s birth. About 47 percent 
of mothers took a form of paid 
leave (e.g., paid maternity leave, 
paid sick leave, or paid vacation 
leave) after the birth of their first 
child, compared to only 23.6 
percent before their first child was 
born. Within the detailed leave 
categories, 38.1 percent of mothers 
used paid maternity leave after 
their child was born, compared to 
18.3 percent who used the leave 
type before their first child was 
born. Similarly, 22.8 percent of

mothers took unpaid maternity 
leave after their child was born, 
compared to 12.2 percent who 
took the leave type before their 
child was born. Among first-time 
fathers, a higher percentage took 
a form of paid leave (32.3 percent 
and 4.3 percent, respectively) and 
unpaid leave (7.1 percent and 1.7 
percent, respectively) after the 
birth compared to before the birth 
of their first child. The percentage 
of fathers who took paid vacation 
leave was higher after their first 
child was born (15.3 percent) 
compared to before (1.3 percent).

Mothers and fathers varied in the 
types of leave taken surrounding 
their first birth. After the birth of 
their first child, fathers were more 
likely to take vacation leave (15.3 
percent) compared to paternity 
leave (13.5 percent) and sick leave 
(4.5 percent).43 Mothers were more 
likely to take unpaid maternity

leave (22.8 percent) compared to 
unpaid sick leave (4.4 percent) 
after their first birth. About 5 
percent of fathers took unpaid 
paternity leave, and 1.7 percent 
of fathers reported taking unpaid 
sick leave either before or after 
their first child’s birth. A higher 
percentage of mothers (28.7 
percent) compared to fathers (7.5 
percent) took any type of unpaid 
leave before or after the birth of 
their first child.

First-time mothers were more 
likely to quit or be let go from their 
jobs before than after the birth. 
Mothers were more likely to quit 
their job before their first child 
was born (12.4 percent) compared 
to after their first child was born 
(8.5 percent). Similarly, mothers 
were more likely to be let go 
before their first child was born 
(1.5 percent) than after their first 
child was born (roughly 1 percent). 
About 17 percent of mothers quit 
their job either before or after the 
birth of their first child.

Regarding the absence of leave-
taking, a substantial portion of 
first-time fathers and a moderate 
share of mothers did not take 
leave before or after the birth of 
their first child. Over half of fathers 
(58.6 percent) did not take any 
leave before or after the birth of 
their first child. About 16 percent 
of mothers did not take leave at 
any point before or after their first 
birth. Mothers were more likely 
to report not taking leave after 
the first birth (13.7 percent) than 
before the first birth (4.6 percent).

Figure 3 presents the types of 
leave used in the 12 weeks after 
the birth of a first child, by the sex 
of the parent. Figure 3 excludes 
parents who quit, were let go from 
their job, or did not take leave in 
the 12 weeks following their child’s 
first birth.

Fathers and mothers differed on 
the types of leave taken within 
the 12 weeks after the birth of 
their first child. For example, 49.8 
percent of mothers took paid 

9

parental leave in the 12 weeks after 
birth compared to 33.1 percent of 
fathers. First-time fathers were 
more likely to take vacation leave 
(36.6 percent) than mothers (6.8 
percent). Within 12 weeks after 
the birth of their first child, 29.7 
percent of mothers took unpaid 
parental leave, compared to about 
13 percent of fathers. Compared 
to mothers (8.3 percent), a higher 
percentage of fathers used paid 
sick leave (11.2 percent) after the 
birth of their first child.

SUMMARY

This report presents recent 
estimates on various parental 
leave measures, highlighting work 
behaviors and detailed leave 
arrangements used by working 
parents surrounding the birth of 
their first child. The gap between 
fathers and mothers who work 
before the birth of their first 
child is getting smaller, and an 
increasing percentage of mothers 
participate in the labor force prior 
to giving birth (Figure 1). After the 
birth of a first child, both fathers 
and mothers had high rates of 
returning to work, ranging from 
80 to 98 percent depending 
on various demographic 
characteristics (Table 1). Figure 2 
details an increase in paid leave 
rates for fathers and mothers 
across birth cohorts over time. 
Additionally, the estimates indicate 

a declining trend in the percentage 
of fathers not taking leave. These 
findings suggest variations in 
parental leave benefits among 
working parents with a recent 
(2014 to 2022) first-born child.  
The report explains that mothers 
rely on both paid and unpaid forms 
of leave, whether before or after 
the birth of their first child (Table 
2). Overall, the findings suggest 
that while a portion of working 
parents takes a form of paid leave 
before or after the birth of their 
first child, a considerable number 
of working parents rely on unpaid 
or alternative leave arrangements 
or do not take leave at all.

SOURCE AND ACCURACY

Statistics from surveys are subject 
to sampling and nonsampling 
error. All comparisons presented 
in this report have taken 
sampling error into account 
and are significant at the 90 
percent confidence level, unless 
otherwise noted. This means the 
90 percent confidence interval 
for the difference between the 
estimates being compared does 
not include zero. Nonsampling 
error in surveys may be attributed 
to a variety of sources, such as 
how the survey was designed, how 
respondents interpret questions, 
how able and willing respondents 
are to provide correct answers, 
and how accurately the answers 

are coded and classified. To 
minimize these errors, the Census 
Bureau employs quality control 
procedures throughout the 
production process, including the 
overall design of surveys, wording 
of questions, review of the work 
of interviewers and coders, and 
the statistical review of reports.
