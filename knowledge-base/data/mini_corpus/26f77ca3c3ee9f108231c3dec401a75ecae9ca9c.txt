Understanding and Using
the American Community
Survey Public Use
Microdata Sample Files:
What Data Users Need to
Know

February 2021

The U.S. Census Bureau produces a
large number of data profiles, tables,
maps, and other products based on
American Community Survey (ACS)

data. Even this abundance of
pretabulated estimates and data
products cannot meet the needs of
every data user. The Census Bureau’s
ACS Public Use Microdata Sample
(PUMS) files enable data users to
create custom estimates and tables,
free of charge, that are not available
through pretabulated ACS data
products.

This guide provides an overview of
the ACS PUMS files and how they
can be used to access data about
America’s communities.
