We ask questions about a person's place of birth, citizenship,

and year of entry into the United States to create data about

citizens, noncitizens, and the foreign-born population.

Agencies and policymakers use our published statistics to set

and evaluate immigration policies and laws, understand the

experience of different immigrant groups, and enforce laws,

policies, and regulations against discrimination based on

national origin. These statistics also help tailor services to

accommodate cultural differences.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci

and law enforcement.

Questions as they appear on the form

We ask three questions that cover information on place of birth, citizenship, and year of entry to
better understand the composition of our nation's changing population.

Place of birth, citizenship, and date of entry data help communities:

Ensure Equal Opportunity

We ask about people in the community born in other countries in combination with information about housing, language spoken 

home, employment, and education, to help government and communities enforce laws, regulations, and policies against

discrimination based on national origin. For example, these data are used to support the enforcement responsibilities under the

Voting Rights Act to investigate differences in voter participation rates and to enforce other laws and policies regarding bilingual

requirements.

Educate Children

We ask about individuals' place of birth, citizenship, and year of entry in combination with other information, such as language

spoken at home, to help schools understand the needs of their students and qualify for grants that help fund programs for those
students (Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965). Statistics on how many foreign-born children depend on services

through schools help school districts make stafﬁng and funding decisions.

Understand Change

Researchers, advocacy groups, and policymakers are interested in knowing whether people of different races or countries of birt

have the same opportunities in areas such as education, employment, and home ownership. These data may also help to identif
communities with large refugee populations that qualify for ﬁnancial assistance (Immigration Nationality Act).

History of place of birth, citizenship, year of entry questions

Citizenship originated with the 1820 Census, place of birth originated with the 1850 Census, and year of entry originated with the
1890 Census. They transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the decennial census long form.
