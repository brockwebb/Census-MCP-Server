Note: The coverage rates by race group for 2020-2021 should be used with caution due to changes in the race question that we

implemented in 2020. While the ACS pre-controlled estimates reﬂect the change in race distribution due to the new race questio
the independent population estimates used for comparison currently do not. Thus the observed coverage rate represents a

mixture of the true coverage rate and the effect of this methodological difference. The coverage rate for American Indian and
Alaska Native non-Hispanic is especially impacted. For more information on how the question was changed, please see

Improvements to the Race Question [https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2021-
03.html] . For more information on the population controls, please see Population Controls for the 2021 ACS

[https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2022-10.html] .

Note: The effects of the pandemic on ACS activities in 2020 impacted the coverage rates. For more information, see the Analyti

Report [https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2021/acs/2021_CensusBureau_01.html] . Additionally for 2020, a small
number of vacant housing unit addresses that had been originally coded as non-interviews were converted to vacant units throu

a modeling process in order to improve ACS estimates. For more information, see the user note
[https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2021-05.html] .

ACS until 2006.
