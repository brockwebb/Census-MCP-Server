The American Community Survey
The Foundation

The American Community Survey is on the leading edge of survey design, 
continuous improvement, and data quality

• The nation’s most current, reliable, and accessible data source for local 
statistics on critical planning topics such as age, children, veterans, 
commuting, education, income, and employment

• Surveys 3.5 million addresses and informs over $675 billion of federal 

government spending each year

• Covers 40+ topics, supports over 300 evidence-based Federal government 

uses, and produces 11 billion estimates each year
• Typically provides three key annual data releases:

• 1-year Estimates (for large populations, geographies of 65,000+ 

population)

• 1-year Supplemental Estimates (for small populations, geographies of 

20,000+ population)

• 5-year Estimates (for very small populations, geographies down to 

Census Tracts and Block Groups)

What is the Margin of Error (MOE)

Definition: An MOE is a measure of the possible variation of the estimate around the population value

• At a given confidence level, the estimate and actual population value will differ by no more than the MOE

•

90% confidence level is the Census standard and ACS MOEs are provided in the same unit as the estimate

Example: How many males under age 5 live in WY?

Lower bound = 19,649 - 310 = 19,339

Upper bound = 19,649 + 310 = 19,959

We are 90% confident the true number of males under 
age 5 in Wyoming falls between 19,339 and 19,959

What is an Application Programming Interface (API)?

• Data Service which enables data providers to provide their data in a standardized way and 

hosted from a Central location

• Allows data users to have more direct access to data in order to conduct analyses

• Gives software and web developers the ability to create and easily update custom 

applications
