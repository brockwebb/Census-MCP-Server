American
Communi
ty Survey

February 2020

Finding fresh data for news stories
used to be difficult. With the U.S.

Census Bureau’s American
Community Survey (ACS), data are

now available on a wide range of
topics, whenever they are needed.
The ACS provides journalists with
data they can use to strengthen
news coverage and feature stories

with up-to-date social, economic,
housing, and demographic
information about America’s
communities. The ACS has become
a valuable resource for data-driven
journalism—where the goal is to tell
compelling stories that are grounded
in data.

This guide provides a brief overview
of how journalists are using ACS
data to make comparisons across
geographic areas and population
subgroups, support anecdotal
evidence by providing a broader
context, report on trends and
reversals, and conduct research. It
also describes some important
considerations when working with
ACS data—particularly estimates for

small geographic areas and small
population groups.

For quick information on ACS data to
jumpstart data-driven stories, check
