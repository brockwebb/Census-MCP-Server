Understanding and Using
American Community
Survey Data: What All Data
Users Need to Know

September 2020

Have you ever thought about how, or
why, new roads, schools, after-school

programs, or hospitals are placed in
communities? What makes

communities attractive to new
businesses or tourists? Why there is
no ATM or bike-share kiosk on a
street corner? The answers often lie
in the numbers—numbers that reflect

what our communities look like, how
our communities have changed, and
how those changes impact our daily
lives.

The U.S. Census Bureau’s American
Community Survey (ACS) is designed

to answer these types of questions
and to meet the needs of
policymakers, business leaders,
planners, and others nationwide who
need good data to make informed
decisions. The ACS provides a
detailed portrait of the social,
economic, housing, and
demographic characteristics of
America’s communities.
