States: 2005–2023

Report Number: ACS-60

A population’s composition and distribution are directly affected by geographic mobility, sometimes referred to as

migration. Geographic mobility is the movement of people from one place to another. Rates of geographic mobility
vary by key demographic, socioeconomic, and temporal factors. Importantly, changes in geographic mobility do not

happen uniformly across all population groups.

A large and growing body of research tells us that age, calendar year, and birth cohort play essential roles in

understanding a population at any one point in time. Of particular interest is the birth cohort—groups of people who
were born in the same timeframe. These people pass through life together and experience key historical events at
similar ages. Birth cohorts are often informally referred to as “generations.”

This brief uses American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year data from 2005 to 2023 and examines all people 1 year or
older and who were born after the year 1927.
