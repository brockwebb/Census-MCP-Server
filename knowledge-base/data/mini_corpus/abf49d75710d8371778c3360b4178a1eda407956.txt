We ask questions about whether a person is attending school

or college to create statistics about enrollment.

Local, state, tribal, and federal agencies use enrollment data to

analyze the characteristics and needs of school-aged children

and understand the continuing education needs of adults.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci

and law enforcement.

Question as it appears on the form

Educate Children and Adults

We ask about school enrollment in combination with other information, such as disability status, language spoken at home, and

poverty status, to help schools understand the needs of their students and qualify for grants that help fund programs for those

students (Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965). Information on how many children and adults depend on services

through schools helps school districts make long-term building, stafﬁng, and funding decisions.

Ensure Equal Opportunity

We ask about the characteristics of people enrolled or not enrolled in school to help government and communities enforce laws,

regulations, and policies against discrimination in education (Civil Rights Act of 1964).

History of school enrollment question

School enrollment originated with the 1850 Census. It was transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the decennial census

long form.
