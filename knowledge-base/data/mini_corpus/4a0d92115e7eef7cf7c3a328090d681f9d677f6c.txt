We ask questions about whether a person speaks a language

other than English at home, what language he/she speaks, and

how well he/she speaks English to create statistics about

language and the ability to speak English.

Local, state, tribal, and federal agencies use language data to

plan government programs for adults and children who do not

speak English well. These data are also used to ensure that

information about public health, law, regulations, voting, and

safety is communicated in languages that community members

understand.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci

and law enforcement.

Question as it appears on the form

We ask one question about whether people speak a language other than English at home, what
language they speak, and how well they speak English to create a proﬁle of the languages
spoken in communities.

Language spoken at home data help communities:

Educate Children

We ask about language spoken at home in combination with other information, such as disability status, school enrollment, and

poverty status, to help schools understand the needs of their students and qualify for grants that help fund programs for those

students (Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965). Information on how many children and youth with limited English-

speaking abilities who depend on services provided through schools helps school districts make long-term stafﬁng and funding

decisions.

Ensure Equal Opportunity

We want to know about the languages spoken by people in the community in combination with information about housing, voting

employment, and education, to help the government and communities enforce laws, regulations, and policies against
discrimination based on national origin. For example, language data are used to support the enforcement responsibilities under

the Voting Rights Act to investigate differences in voter participation rates and to enforce laws and policies related to bilingual
election requirements. Knowing languages spoken in a community also helps federal agencies identify needs for services for

people with limited English proﬁciency under Executive Order 13166.

Understand Changes

Researchers, advocacy groups, and policymakers are interested in knowing whether people who speak languages
other than English have the same opportunities in education, employment, voting, home ownership, and many other

areas. For example, language data are used with age and ancestry data to address language and cultural diversity
needs in health care plans for the older population.

History of language spoken at home question

The language spoken at home question originated with the 1890 Census. It was transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced
the decennial census long form.
