INTRODUCTION

This brief examines household wealth at the end of 
2022 using the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023 Survey 
of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) public-
use data.1 It highlights differences in asset ownership 
and debt-holding rates and demonstrates significant 
variation in median household wealth by demographic 
and economic characteristics such as education and 
income. By illustrating how wealth varies across  
U.S. households, this brief provides key insights into 
the economic well-being of households.2

THE DISTRIBUTION OF HOUSEHOLD WEALTH

Wealth can vary dramatically across households. For 
example, a household with few assets and a heavy 
debt load may have negative wealth in the tens of 
thousands of dollars. Conversely, a household that 
owns its own home and has multiple retirement 
accounts may have positive wealth in the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars.

Table 1 presents the value of household wealth by 
percentile. The median household wealth in 2022 was 
$176,500. The 10th percentile of household wealth was 
zero dollars, meaning 1 in 10 households had wealth of 
zero dollars or less. The 90th percentile of household 
wealth was $1,603,000, meaning 1 in 10 households 
had wealth exceeding $1.6 million.

ensure appropriate access, use, and disclosure avoidance protec-
tion of the confidential source data (Project No. P-7516454, Dataset 
D-0000004561, Approval CBDRB-FY24-0222).

² All estimates include households with negative wealth.

WHAT IS SIPP?

The Survey of Income and Program Participation 
(SIPP) is a nationally representative, longitudinal 
survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau 
that provides comprehensive information on the 
dynamics of income, employment, household 
composition, and government program partici-
pation. The SIPP is also a leading source of data 
on economic well-being, family dynamics, edu-
cation, wealth, health insurance, child care, and 
food security. The SIPP interviews individuals for 
several years and provides monthly data about 
changes in household and family composition 
and economic circumstances over time. Visit the 
SIPP website at <www.census.gov/sipp> for more 
information.

KEY CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS

A household consists of a group of people 
occupying a housing unit together (group quar-
ters, such as dormitories, institutions, or nurs-
ing homes, are excluded from the analysis). The 
householder is a person who owns or rents the 
housing unit (i.e., a person whose name appears 
on the deed or lease).

Wealth is the value of assets owned minus the 
debts owed. Therefore, wealth can be negative. 
The major assets not covered in this measure are 
equity in pension plans and the value of home 
furnishings.

Household wealth percentile is the dollar amount 
below which a given percentage of households 
fall. The 50th percentile is also referred to as the 
median.

THE DISTRIBUTION OF 
HOUSEHOLD WEALTH BY 
RACE AND ETHNICITY

Figure 1 presents the distribu-
tion of household wealth by 
the race and ethnicity of the 
householder. Households with a 
White, non-Hispanic or an Asian, 
non-Hispanic householder were 
more likely to have wealth over 
$1 million when compared to 
other households (20.0 and 29.3 
percent, respectively). Meanwhile, 
4.0 percent of households with 
a Black, non-Hispanic house-
holder, 7.5 percent with a Hispanic 
householder of any race, and 11.5 
percent with a householder of any 
other race group or combination 
had wealth over $1 million. 

Households with negative wealth 
are more likely than other house-
holds to experience higher rates of 
financial insecurity and are more 
vulnerable to economic shocks. 
Around 21 percent of households 
with a Black, non-Hispanic house-
holder, 15.5 percent with a Hispanic 
householder of any race, and 16.0 
percent with a householder of any 
other race group or combination 

had zero or negative wealth.3 
Fewer than 10 percent of house-
holds with a White, non-Hispanic 
or Asian, non-Hispanic house-
holder had zero or negative wealth 
(8.4 and 6.6 percent, respectively).

MEDIAN WEALTH 
BY HOUSEHOLD 
CHARACTERISTICS

Figure 2 depicts how median 
wealth varied by demographic and 
economic characteristics of the 
household according to the 2023 
SIPP.

The data suggest that households 
generally accumulate more wealth 
as they age. For households in 
which the householder was under 
the age of 35, median wealth was 
$31,110 in 2022. For households 
in which the householder was 
between 70 and 74 years old, 
median household wealth was 
$403,000, or about 2.3 times the 
value of overall median wealth 
($176,500). Figure 2 also suggests 
that aging households eventu-
ally draw down their wealth. For 
households in which the house-
holder was at least 75 years old, 
median household wealth was 
$307,900, or about 80 percent of 
the median household wealth for 
householders between 70 and 74 
years old.

Higher education was associated 
with more wealth. Median wealth 
among households in which the 
most educated member held a 
high school diploma was $57,020, 
or 6.6 times greater than house-
holds in which no member had a

ference between the share of households

with a Hispanic householder and those 
with a householder of another race or race 
combination.

high school diploma. Households 
in which the most educated mem-
ber had a bachelor’s degree had 
a median wealth of $287,600, 5.0 
times greater than those in which 
the most educated member held a 
high school diploma.

Households with higher annual 
incomes had more wealth. When 
households are separated into 
income quintiles (meaning five 
equally sized groups ordered by 
income from lowest to highest), a 
meaningful wealth difference can 
be found between the highest, 
the middle, and the lowest income 
households.4 For example, the 
median wealth of households in 
the lowest income group (lowest 
quintile) was 7.3 percent of the 
median wealth of households in 
the middle income group (third 
quintile). The median wealth of 
households in the third income 
quintile was 20.6 percent of the 
median wealth of the households 
with the highest income (highest 
quintile).

Homeowners were wealthier than 
renters. Households that owned 
their home had a median wealth 
about 44 times larger than those 
that rented. If home equity is 
excluded from total wealth, the 
median wealth of households that 
owned their home was about 17 
times that of the median house-
hold that rented. In other words, 
home equity alone did not account 
for the difference in median wealth 
between households that owned 
and households that rented.

⁴ Thresholds for income quintiles differ 
across survey years. In the 2023 SIPP public-
use data, we define the lowest quintile as 
household income at or below $30,109. The 
middle quintile includes households with 
income between $59,184 and $96,024. The 
highest quintile is defined as household 
income above $157,408.

¹ Asset values are net of debts held against them, otherwise known as equity. Wealth is also net of all unsecured debts.
² Estimates of median value are conditional on asset ownership or possession of the relevant debt type. If a household held an asset or debt 

type during the reference year but reported its value to be zero dollars as of December 31 (e.g., because the asset was sold or the debt paid off), 
the zero is included in the median calculation.

The median wealth of married 
householders was greater at all 
age levels than that of unmarried 
householders. For example, mar-
ried householders under the age 
of 35 had a median wealth 13.8 
times that of unmarried female 
householders and 4.3 times that of 
unmarried male householders. This 
pattern suggests that the gaps in 
median wealth cannot solely be 
attributed to the presence of an 
additional adult in the household; 
otherwise, married householders 
would have no more than twice 
the median wealth of unmarried 
householders.

There are also statistically sig-
nificant differences in median 
wealth between men and women 

U.S. Census Bureau 

for some age groups. For those 
under the age of 35, 35 to 54, and 
65 and over, the median wealth of 
unmarried female householders 
was less than the median wealth of 
unmarried male householders. For 
example, unmarried female house-
holders under the age of 35 had 
a median wealth of $8,040 (30.9 
percent of their unmarried male 
counterparts’ wealth). But among 
those aged 55 to 64, the difference 
in median wealth between unmar-
ried male and female householders 
was not statistically significant.

ASSET OWNERSHIP RATES 
AND VALUES

The SIPP collects data on 
many different asset types; the 

ownership rates and median values 
of these assets are presented in 
Table 2.5 In calculating median 
asset value, equity is the value of 
an asset net of any secured debts 
held against it. For example, the 
mortgage balance is subtracted 
from the value of a home to cal-
culate home equity. Therefore, the 
value of these secured assets may 
be negative.

Assets at financial institutions 
(such as checking and savings 
accounts) and vehicle equity were 

⁵ Estimates of median value are condi-
tional on asset ownership or holding of the 
relevant debt type. If a household held an 
asset or debt type during the reference year 
but reported its value to be zero dollars 
as of December 31 (e.g., because the asset 
was sold or the debt paid off), the zero is 
included in the median calculation.

the most common assets. In 2022, 
95.8 percent of households had 
assets at financial institutions and 
82.4 percent owned vehicles. The 
median values of these two asset 
classes were among the lowest 
values: $10,600 for assets at finan-
cial institutions and $13,200 for 
vehicles.6 

The assets with the highest median 
values were primary home equity 
($198,000) and rental property 
equity ($200,000).7 Equity in one’s 
own home was the third-most 
common asset class; 62.2 percent 
of households owned a home dur-
ing the year. Rental property was 
among the least commonly held 
assets, owned by 6.7 percent of 
households.

Retirement accounts were also 
a major source of wealth with a 
median value of $75,000. They 
were the fourth-most common 
asset class, owned by 60.3 percent 
of households.

RATES AND VALUES OF 
UNSECURED DEBT HOLDINGS

Table 2 also shows debt-holding 
rates and the values of unsecured 
debts (e.g., credit card or medical 
debt). Unsecured debts differ from 
secured debts in that they have no 
asset backing them. For example, 
a lender cannot repossess some-
one’s education if the individual 
fails to pay a student loan, the way 
an auto lender might repossess a 
car. By including unsecured debts, 
Table 2 provides a more com-
plete picture of the debts held by 
households.

In 2022, 54.4 percent of house-
holds had some unsecured debt. 
Credit card debt was the most 
common form of unsecured debt, 
held by 41.9 percent of households. 
Student loans, held by 17.1 percent 
of households, was the category 
with the highest median amount 
owed at $22,000. About 14 per-
cent of households had medical 
debt; the median amount owed 
was $2,000.

THE COMPOSITION OF 
HOUSEHOLD WEALTH

Median asset values vary across 
asset types, meaning that some 
commonly held assets are a small 
part of overall wealth (Table 2). 
Therefore, to illustrate the com-
position of wealth, Figure 3 shows 
aggregate household wealth 
decomposed by asset type.8 

Because the asset holdings of 
extremely wealthy households 
are not representative of the rest 
of the population, this section 
focuses on households at or below 
the 99th percentile of net worth.

In 2022, home equity and retire-
ment accounts composed 
the majority (63.5 percent) of 
aggregate household wealth. 
Specifically, 32.1 percent of house-
hold wealth was held in retire-
ment accounts, and home equity 
accounted for 31.4 percent of 
household wealth.9 

Despite being the two most com-
monly held assets, assets at finan-
cial institutions and vehicle equity 
accounted for 9.2 percent and 2.9 

⁶ The median values of assets at financial 

institutions and vehicles are statistically 
lower than the median values of equity in 
own home, retirement accounts, other real 
estate, stocks and mutual funds, and rental 
property.

⁷ The difference between median rental 
property equity and median primary home 
equity was not statistically significant.

⁸ The aggregate value of wealth is 
defined as the sum of wealth across all  
U.S. households. To calculate the share of 
wealth held in a specific asset category, 
the value of the asset (net of any debt held 
against it) is summed across all households 
and divided by aggregate household wealth.

⁹ The share of household wealth held in 
retirement accounts was not statistically dif-
ferent from the share held in home equity.

percent of aggregate household 
wealth, respectively.10 

Dividing the total value of unse-
cured debt among all households 
by the total value of household 
wealth, unsecured debt was 2.8 
percent of aggregate wealth. 
Student loans and other education-
related expenses accounted for the 
largest share of unsecured debt 
in the United States. Although 
the magnitude of these expenses 
was equivalent to 1.4 percent of 
aggregate wealth, they accounted 
for about 50 percent of unsecured 
debt.

SUMMARY

Estimates presented in this brief 
illustrate the wide variation in 
household wealth and, therefore, 
the economic well-being of house-
holds. Assets at financial institu-
tions (such as checking or savings 
accounts) and vehicle equity were 
the most commonly held assets, 
but they only accounted for a 
relatively small portion of aggre-
gate household wealth. Retirement 
accounts and home equity made 
up the majority of aggregate 
household wealth.

Additionally, the estimates dem-
onstrate significant variation in 
median wealth by demographic 
and economic characteristics, 
namely age, education, income, 
home ownership, and marital 
status.

Nonsampling errors in surveys 
may be attributed to a variety of 
sources, such as how the survey

overall design of surveys, wording 

of questions, review of the work of 
interviewers and coders, and the 
statistical review of reports.
