Comparing 2010 American
Community Survey 1-Year
Estimates of Occupancy
Status, Vacancy Status, and
Household Size with the
2010 Census - Preliminary
Results

December 20, 2011
Written by: Deborah H. Griffin

The 2010 Census and the American Community Survey (ACS) both measure occupancy status, vacancy

status, and household size. This report will: (1) document comparisons of published information on
these measures from the 2010 ACS with the 2010 Census (2) discuss the design and methodology

differences of the ACS and the 2010 Census that likely contribute to the observed measurement

differences We will highlight where differences exist and identify possible explanations for the

differences. These differences do not necessarily imply errors exist in either the ACS or the 2010 Census
results. To the extent interviewers and enumerators misclassified housing units, this report will not try to

determine if the ACS or the Census was more correct.
