government programs that provide food assistance and in

evaluating other government programs.

Food Stamp/SNAP data help communities:

Provide Food Assistance to School Children

We want to know more about food assistance program

participation in combination with school enrollment, income,

and poverty status, to help communities streamline

administration of the National School Lunch Program and

School Breakfast Program. With this information we can

replace administrative paperwork with American Community

Survey estimates of students eligible for free and reduced-price

meals.

Evaluate SNAP

Information about food-assistance program participation is

used to evaluate the SNAP program and award bonuses to

communities that successfully administer SNAP funds.

Understand Changes

State and local agencies use these statistics to assess state
food assistance needs and participation rates for eligible

families and individuals and to determine gaps in services and
programs. Faith-based and other nonproﬁt organizations use

information about food assistance needs to determine where
food banks, food kitchens, and other programs could be

beneﬁcial and how the needs of their communities can be met

with additional resources and services.

History of Food Stamp/SNAP question
