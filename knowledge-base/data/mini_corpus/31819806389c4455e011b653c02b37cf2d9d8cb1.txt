Understanding and Using
American Community
Survey Data: What Users of
Data for Rural Areas Need
to Know

October 2020

Suppose a state office on aging

wants to gauge the potential need

for a “healthy aging” initiative in rural

communities. Or an entrepreneur in a
small Midwestern town is interested
in opening an auto parts business

but needs to know more about local
commuting patterns and how they
have changed over time. Or a local
government official wants
information about the number of
vacant housing units in a sparsely
populated county.

Where would they go to find the
necessary information?

The U.S. Census Bureau’s American
Community Survey (ACS) is designed
to answer these types of questions
and meet the needs of policymakers,
business leaders, planners, and
others who need good data to make
informed decisions. The ACS

provides a detailed portrait of the
social, economic, housing, and
demographic characteristics of
America’s communities—including
the characteristics of people and
households in rural areas.
