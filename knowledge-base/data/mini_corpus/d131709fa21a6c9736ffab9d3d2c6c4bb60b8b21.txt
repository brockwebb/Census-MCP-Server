Poverty in States and Metropolitan 
Areas: 2023

American Community Survey Briefs

By Craig Benson

ACSBR-022

September 2024

INTRODUCTION

Planners, policymakers, and community stakeholders 
use poverty estimates as key indicators to evaluate 
trends and current economic conditions within 
communities and to make comparisons across 
demographic groups. Federal and state governments 
often use these estimates to allocate funds to local 
communities. Government agencies, researchers, and 
local organizations regularly use these estimates to 
identify the number of individuals and families eligible 
for various programs and to measure economic 
well-being.

This brief uses the 2022 and 2023 American 
Community Survey (ACS), 1-year estimates and 
the 2022 and 2023 Puerto Rico Community Survey 
(PRCS) to analyze poverty rates for calendar year 
2023, as well as the changes in poverty from calendar 
year 2022 for the nation, states, the District of 
Columbia, Puerto Rico, and metropolitan statistical 
areas (MSAs).1, 2

1 The U.S. Census Bureau has reviewed this data product to 

ensure appropriate access, use, and disclosure avoidance protection 
of the confidential source data used to produce this product (Data 
Management System [DMS] number: P-7533841, Disclosure Review 
Board [DRB] approval number: CBDRB-FY24-0138). All comparative 
statements have undergone statistical testing and are statistically 
significant at the 90 percent confidence level, unless otherwise noted.

2 Metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs or metro areas) are 
geographic entities delineated by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for use by federal statistical agencies in collecting, 
tabulating, and publishing federal statistics. A metro area contains 
a core urban area with a population of 50,000 or more individuals. 
For more information, refer to <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/
metro-micro/about/omb-standards.html>.

This brief also discusses the distribution of people 
by income-to-poverty ratios for the aforementioned 
geographic areas, measuring the depth of poverty for 
those with incomes below their poverty threshold and 
those just above their poverty threshold.3

HIGHLIGHTS

•  The poverty rate decreased in seven states and 
Puerto Rico between 2022 and 2023. Poverty 
increased in three states and did not significantly 
change in 40 states and the District of Columbia. 
Poverty rates in states ranged from 7.2 percent in 
New Hampshire to 18.9 percent in Louisiana in 2023. 

•  In 3 of the 25 most populous metropolitan areas, 
poverty significantly changed between 2022 and 
2023. Poverty decreased in the Minneapolis MSA 
(from 8.8 percent to 8.1 percent) and increased in 
two metro areas: the Atlanta MSA, from 10.0 per-
cent to 11.0 percent, and the Charlotte MSA, from 
9.8 percent to 10.7 percent. 

•  The states ranged from 3.8 percent to 8.9 percent 
of population with income below 50 percent of 
their poverty threhold in 2023.

3 The data collection period for the 2022 ACS spanned January to 
December 2022; the data collection period for the 2023 ACS spanned 
January to December 2023.

POVERTY

In 2023, 12.5 percent of the total 
U.S. population had income 
below their respective poverty 
thresholds, a substantively 
small but statistically significant 
decrease from the 2022 estimate 
of 12.6 percent.4 The total number 
of people in the United States with 
income below their respective 
poverty threshold decreased by 
more than 180,000 compared to 
2022 (Appendix Table 1). Poverty 
has declined in 8 of the last 9 years 
measured since 2013 (estimates 
for 2020 experimental data are 
not included). The only increase 
in poverty was between 2019 and 
2021 (Figure 1).5, 6

4 Following the standard specified by 
OMB in Statistical Policy Directive 14, data 
from the Current Population Survey Annual 
Social Economic Supplement are used to 
estimate the official national poverty rate 
that can be found in the report “Poverty in 
the United States: 2023,” available at <www.
census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/
publications/2023/demo/p60-280.html>. 
The national poverty percentage does not 
include data for Puerto Rico.

5 The U.S. poverty rate increased from 

2019 to 2021. Estimates for 2021 were com-
pared to 2019, the last previous year with 
consistent weighting methodologies. For 
additional information on the 2020 experi-
mental data, refer to <www.census.gov/
programs-surveys/acs/data/experimental-
data.html>.

6 All year-to-year changes from 2005 

to 2023, except between 2005–2006, 
2011–2012, and 2012–2013, were statistically 
significant.

How Poverty is Measured

Poverty status is determined by comparing annual income to a 
set of dollar values (called poverty thresholds) that vary by family 
size, number of children, and the age of the householder. If a 
family’s pretax money income is less than the dollar value of their 
threshold, then that family and every individual in it are considered 
to be in poverty.* For people not living in families, poverty status 
is determined by comparing individuals’ income to their poverty 
threshold.

The poverty thresholds are updated annually to account for changes 
in the cost of living using the Consumer Price Index for all Urban 
Consumers (CPI-U). They do not vary geographically.

Poverty status is determined for individuals in housing units and 
noninstitutional group quarters. The poverty universe excludes 
children under the age of 15 who are not related to the householder, 
people living in institutional group quarters (e.g., nursing homes or 
correctional facilities), and people living in college dormitories or 
military barracks. Population figures used in this brief reflect this 
poverty universe.

The American Community Survey (ACS) is a continuous survey, and 
people respond throughout the year. Since income is reported for 
the previous 12 months, the appropriate poverty threshold for each 
family is determined by multiplying the base-year poverty threshold 
from 1982 by the average of monthly CPI-U values for the 12 months 
preceding the survey month.

Survey and Puerto Rico Community Survey 2023 Subject 
Definitions” at <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-
documentation/code-lists.html>. For more information on ACS 
sample design and other topics, refer to <www.census.gov/acs>.

* Pretax money income refers to gross income received from a variety of sources like 
earnings, Social Security, pensions, and disability benefits. It does not include tax 
credits, like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Child Tax Credit, nor does it 
include noncash benefits such as subsidized housing or nutritional assistance programs.

at <www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html>.

While the national 2023 poverty 
rate was 12.5 percent, there 
was variability among census 
regions, as poverty was not 
evenly distributed throughout 
the country.9 Seven out of the 
nine states in the Northeast had 
poverty rates of 11.9 percent or 
less, and three had poverty rates 
in the lowest map category (less 
than 10.0 percent), whereas 

9 Census regions are groupings of states 
and the District of Columbia that divide the 
United States for the presentation of Census 
Bureau data. For more information, refer to 
<https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-
data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf>.

nearly one-half (seven states) of 
Southern states had poverty rates 
of 15.0 percent or more. Seven 
other southern states were in the 
second-highest map category 
(12.0 percent to 14.9 percent). 
Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia 
were the only three southern 
states not in the two highest 
poverty categories. States in the 
Midwest were consistently in the 
middle categories, with all but two 
states between 10.0 percent and 
14.9 percent (Minnesota and North 
Dakota being the exceptions, both 

in the lowest poverty category). 
The West had 10 of its 13 states in 
the middle categories, along with 
two states in the lowest poverty 
category and one state in the 
highest (Figure 2). 

In 2023, poverty rates decreased 
in seven states (Arkansas, Florida, 
Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, North 
Dakota, and West Virginia) and 
Puerto Rico compared to 2022, 
whereas poverty rates increased in 
three states (Georgia, Tennessee, 
and Utah) (Figure 3). Poverty rates 
did not significantly change in 40 
states and the District of Columbia.

POVERTY IN METROPOLITAN 
AREAS

Figure 4 shows the estimated 
number and percentage of people 
in poverty in 2022 and 2023 for 
the 25 most populous metropolitan 
areas. The Washington, DC (7.9 
percent) and Minneapolis (8.1 
percent) MSAs had among the 
lowest poverty rates.10 Conversely, 

the Houston (13.9 percent), Detroit 
(13.6 percent), and San Antonio 
(13.6 percent) MSAs had among 
the highest poverty rates of the 25 
most populous metropolitan areas 
in 2023.11

Poverty rates changed in 3 of the 
25 most populous metro areas 
compared to 2022. Poverty rates 
decreased in the Minneapolis MSA 

10 The 2023 poverty rates for the 

Washington, DC (7.9 percent) and 
Minneapolis (8.1 percent) MSAs were not

and increased in two metro 
areas: the Atlanta MSA, from 10.0 
percent to 11.0 percent, and the 
Charlotte MSA, from 9.8 percent 
to 10.7 percent. For 22 out of the 
25 MSAs, including the three most 
populous metro areas (New York, 
Los Angeles, and Chicago MSAs), 
poverty rates did not significantly 
change between 2022 and 2023.

INCOME-TO-POVERTY RATIOS

The poverty rate is an estimate 
of the proportion of people with 
income below 100 percent of their 
poverty threshold. In addition 
to this statistic, researchers 
and policymakers are often 
interested in the distribution of 
the population at various levels of 
poverty. Income-to-poverty ratios 
provide information on how close 
a family or individual’s income 
is to their poverty threshold by 
dividing their income by their 
poverty threshold to get a ratio. 
Ratios below 1.0 indicate that a 
family falls below poverty, while 
ratios at or above 1.0 indicate the 
family has income at or above their 
threshold. An income-to-poverty 
ratio of 0.50 indicates that a family 
has income equal to 50 percent of 
their poverty threshold.

Table 1 details the proportion 
of people at various income-to-
poverty ratio ranges in 2023 for 
the nation, states, the District of 
Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The 
share of the U.S. population with 
income below 50 percent of their 
poverty threshold was 6.1 percent 
in 2023 and showed no change 
from 2022 (refer to Appendix 
Table 3 for 2022 estimates). 

New Hampshire (3.8 percent), 
Minnesota (4.3 percent), Idaho 

(4.4 percent), Utah (4.4 percent), 
and North Dakota (4.5 percent) 
were the states with among the 
lowest proportions of people 
with an income-to-poverty ratio 
below 0.50 in 2023.12 Louisiana 
(8.9 percent), New Mexico (8.8 
percent), and the District of 
Columbia (8.2 percent) had among 
the highest proportions of people 
with income-to-poverty ratios 
below 0.50.13 In 2023, 19.6 percent 
of Puerto Rico’s population had 
incomes below 50 percent of their 
poverty thresholds.

In addition to examining the 
share of individuals with income 
below 50 percent of their poverty 
threshold, Table 1 also provides 
information on the share of 
individuals living above their 
poverty thresholds. All people 
with an income-to-poverty ratio 
between 1.00 and 1.24 are referred 
to as being “near poverty” in this 
brief. In 2023, the percentage of 
people in the United States in 

12 In 2023, the percentages of people with 
an income-to-poverty ratio below 50 percent 
in New Hampshire (3.8 percent), Minnesota 
(4.3 percent), Idaho (4.4 percent), Utah (4.4 
percent), and North Dakota (4.5 percent) 
were not statistically different.

13 In 2023, the percentages of people with 
an income-to-poverty ratio below 50 percent 
in Louisiana (8.9 percent), New Mexico (8.8 
percent), and the District of Columbia (8.2 
percent) were not statistically different.

near poverty was 3.6 percent. In 
combination with the share below 
poverty, 16.0 percent of people 
were either in poverty or near 
poverty in 2023.

Among the states, the percentage 
of individuals near poverty in 2023 
ranged from 2.1 to 5.8 percent. 
States with among the lowest 
percentages of individuals living 
near poverty includes the District 
of Columbia (2.1 percent), New 
Hampshire (2.1 percent), Delaware 
(2.2 percent), Colorado (2.5 
percent), Maryland (2.5 percent), 
and Washington (2.5 percent).14 
States with among the highest 
percentages of individuals living 
near poverty include Mississippi 
(5.8 percent) and Arkansas (5.2 
percent).15 The percentage of 
individuals in near poverty in Puerto 
Rico was 9.0 percent in 2023.16

14 In 2023, the percentages of individuals 

with an income-to-poverty ratio between 
1.00 and 1.25 in the District of Columbia 
(2.1 percent), New Hampshire (2.1 per-
cent), Delaware (2.2 percent), Colorado 
(2.5 percent), Maryland (2.5 percent), and 
Washington (2.5 percent) were not signifi-
cantly different.

15 In 2023, the percentages of individuals 

with an income-to-poverty ratio between 
1.00 and 1.25 in Mississippi (5.8 percent) and 
Arkansas (5.2 percent) were not statistically 
different.

Z Represents or rounds to zero.
1 Poverty status is determined for individuals in housing units and noninstitutional group quarters. The poverty universe excludes children under the age of 15 who 
are not related to the householder, people living in institutional group quarters (e.g., nursing homes or correctional facilities), and people living in college dormitories 
or military barracks. People and families are classified as being in poverty if their income is less than their poverty threshold. If their income is less than one-half of their 
poverty threshold, they are below .50 of poverty; less than the threshold itself, they are in poverty (below 100 percent of poverty); less than 1.25 times the threshold, 
below 125 percent of poverty, and so on.

2 Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. A margin of error is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the margin of error in 
relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to or subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval.
Note: For information on confidentialty protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, and definitions, refer to <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-

documentation/code-lists.html>.

1 Poverty status is determined for individuals in housing units and noninstitutional group quarters. The poverty universe excludes children under the age of 15 who 
are not related to the householder, people living in institutional group quarters (e.g., nursing homes or correctional facilities), and people living in college dormitories 
or military barracks. People and families are classified as being in poverty if their income is less than their poverty threshold. If their income is less than one-half of their 
poverty threshold, they are below .50 of poverty; less than the threshold itself, they are in poverty (below 100 percent of poverty); less than 1.25 times the threshold, 
below 125 percent of poverty, and so on.

2 Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. A margin of error is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the margin of error in 
relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to or subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval.

SUMMARY

This brief used the 2022 and 2023 
American Community Survey, 
1-year estimates, and 2022 and 
2023 Puerto Rico Community 
Survey to analyze poverty rates 
for 2023, as well as changes in 
poverty from 2022 for the nation, 
states, the District of Columbia, 
Puerto Rico, and metro areas. 

Poverty rates decreased in seven 
states and Puerto Rico and 
increased in three states. The 
poverty rate in 22 of the 25 most 
populous metropolitan areas did 
not change significantly from 
2022. Poverty rates increased in 
two MSAs and decreased in one, 
compared to 2022.

The percentage of the population 
with incomes below 50 percent of 
their poverty threshold in states 
ranged from 3.8 percent to 8.9 
percent. The 25 most populous 
MSAs ranged from 3.9 percent to 
6.5 percent.

This brief also examined the 
proportion of people slightly 
above their poverty thresholds. 
In the states, the percentage of 
individuals near poverty in 2023 
ranged from 2.1 to 5.8 percent. 
Among the 25 most populous 
metro areas, there was a range 
of 1.9 percent to 4.3 percent of 
people living in near poverty.

SOURCE AND ACCURACY 

The data presented in this brief 
are based on the ACS and PRCS 
sample interviewed from January 
2022 through December 2022 
(2022 ACS and PRCS) and the ACS 
and PRCS sample interviewed from 
January 2023 through December 
2023 (2023 ACS and PRCS). The 
estimates based on these samples 
describe the average values of 
person, household, and housing 
unit characteristics over this 

What Is the American Community Survey? 

The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey 
designed to provide communities with reliable and timely 
demographic, social, economic, and housing data for the nation, 
states, congressional districts, counties, places, and other localities 
every year. It has an annual sample size of about 3.5 million 
addresses across the United States and Puerto Rico and includes 
both housing units and group quarters (e.g., nursing facilities and 
prisons).* The ACS is conducted in every county throughout the 
nation and every municipio in Puerto Rico, where it is called the 
Puerto Rico Community Survey. Beginning in 2006, ACS data have 
been released annually for geographic areas with populations of 
65,000 and greater. For information on the ACS sample design and 
other topics, visit <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs>.

* While people living in group quarters are sampled in the ACS, those living in 
institutional group quarters (e.g., nursing homes or correctional facilities) are not 
included in the poverty universe.

period of collection. Sampling 
error is the uncertainty between 
an estimate based on a sample 
and the corresponding value 
that would be obtained if the 
estimate were based on the entire 
population (as from a census). 
Measures of sampling error are 
provided in the form of margins 
of error for all estimates included 
in this brief. All comparative 
statements in this brief have 
undergone statistical testing, and 
comparisons are significant at the 
90 percent confidence level unless 
otherwise noted. In addition to 
sampling error, nonsampling error 
may be introduced during any 
of the operations used to collect 
and process survey data such as 
editing, reviewing, or keying data 
from questionnaires. For more 
information on sampling and 
estimation methods, confidentiality 
protection, and sampling and 
nonsampling errors, refer to the 
2023 ACS “Accuracy of the Data” 
document located at <www.
census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/
technical-documentation/code-
lists.html>.

NOTES 

ACS data from 2010 forward are 
available on <https://data.census.
gov>. Historical estimates of state 
poverty rates prior to 2010 can 
be found in Appendix Table 1 of 
the brief “Poverty: 2016 and 2017,” 
located at <www.census.gov/
library/publications/2018/acs/
acsbr17-02.html>. 

The Census Bureau also publishes 
poverty estimates based on the 
Current Population Survey Annual 
Social and Economic Supplement 
(CPS ASEC), the Survey of Income 
and Program Participation (SIPP), 
and the Small Area Income and 
Poverty Estimates (SAIPE). For 
information on poverty estimates 
from the ACS and how they differ 
from those based on the CPS 
ASEC, SIPP, and SAIPE, refer

1 Poverty status is determined for individuals in housing units and noninstitutional group quarters. The poverty universe excludes children under the age of 15 who 

are not related to the householder, people living in institutional group quarters (e.g., nursing homes or correctional facilities), and people living in college dormitories or 
military barracks. 

2 Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. A margin of error is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the margin of error in 
relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to or subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval.

1 Poverty status is determined for individuals in housing units and noninstitutional group quarters. The poverty universe excludes children under the age of 15 who 
are not related to the householder, people living in institutional group quarters (e.g., nursing homes or correctional facilities), and people living in college dormitories 
or military barracks. People and families are classified as being in poverty if their income is less than their poverty threshold. If their income is less than one-half of their 
poverty threshold, they are below .50 of poverty; less than the threshold itself, they are in poverty (below 100 percent of poverty); less than 1.25 times the threshold, 
below 125 percent of poverty, and so on.

2 Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. A margin of error is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the margin of error in 
relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to or subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval.
Note: For information on confidentialty protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, and definitions, refer to <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-

documentation/code-lists.html>.
