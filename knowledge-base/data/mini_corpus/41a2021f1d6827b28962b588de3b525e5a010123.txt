Understanding and Using
American Community
Survey Data: What Federal
Agencies Need to Know

March 2021

The American Community Survey
(ACS) is the nation’s premier source

of detailed social, economic,
housing, and demographic

characteristics for local
communities. The ACS is unique
among U.S. household surveys
because of its size, breadth of
measurement, provision of annual

estimates for small geographic
areas, and extensive use by a wide
range of government and
nongovernmental organizations. The
U.S. Census Bureau estimates that
132 programs used census data—
including data from the ACS—to
distribute more than $675 billion in
funds during fiscal year 2015. 
Federal agencies rely on the ACS to
help them make operational
decisions, including managing and
evaluating programs, determining

eligibility for programs, and
benchmarking other statistics.

This handbook describes how
analysts, program administrators,
and policymakers within federal
agencies can use the ACS in carrying

out the business of their agencies.
