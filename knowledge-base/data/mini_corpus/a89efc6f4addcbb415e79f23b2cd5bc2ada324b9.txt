We ask a question about a person's ancestry or ethnic origin to

create statistics about ancestry groups in America.

Local, state, tribal, and federal agencies use data about

ancestry to plan and evaluate government programs and

policies to ensure that they fairly and equitably serve the needs

of all groups. These statistics also help enforce laws,

regulations, and policies against discrimination in society.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities.By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agencie

and law enforcement.

Ancestry data help communities:

Ensure Equal Opportunity

We ask about ancestry in combination with information about housing, voting, language, employment, and education, to help

governments and communities enforce laws, regulations, and policies against discrimination based on national origin. For

example, ancestry data are used to:

Enforce nondiscrimination in education (including monitoring desegregation).
Enforce nondiscrimination in employment by federal agencies, private employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations.
Enforce laws, regulations, and policies against discrimination in federal financial assistance (Civil Rights Act of 1964).

Understand Change

Researchers, advocacy groups, and policymakers are interested in knowing whether people from different backgrounds have th

same opportunities in education, employment, voting, and home ownership. For example, ancestry data are used with age and

language data to address language and cultural diversity needs in health care plans for the older population.

History of ancestry question

The question about a person's ancestry originated with the 1980 Census. It was added to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the

decennial census long form.
