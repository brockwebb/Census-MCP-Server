State Health Insurance
Coverage: 2013, 2019, and
2023

Written by: Douglas Conway
Report Number: ACSBR-021

Health insurance coverage is an important measure of our nationâ€™s overall well-being as it provides greater access to

medical care, protection from high unexpected costs, and more economic stability for individuals and families. At the
same time, health coverage varies over time, reflecting changes in economic conditions, demographic shifts such as

population aging, and policy changes at the federal and state levels that affect access to care. This brief examines
changes in coverage across states for three age groups: children under 19, working-age adults aged 19 to 64, and

adults aged 65 years and older. It looks at these changes from 2013 to 2019 and from 2019 to 2023, using 2013,
2019, and 2023 1-year American Community Survey (ACS) data. It also examines changes in the uninsured rate for the

25 most populous metropolitan areas between 2019 and 2023. These comparisons may help shed light on changes in
health insurance related to important events that occurred at these intervals.
