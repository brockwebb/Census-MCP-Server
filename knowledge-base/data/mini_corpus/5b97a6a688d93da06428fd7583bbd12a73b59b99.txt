We ask questions about the funds a person receives from

various sources to create statistics about income, assistance,

earnings, and poverty status.

Local, state, tribal, and federal agencies use our published

income data to plan and fund programs that provide economic

assistance for populations in need. Income data measure the

economic well-being of the nation. In conjunction with poverty

estimates, these data are often part of funding formulas that

determine the distribution of food, health care, job training,

housing, and other assistance.

Your privacy concerns
"Why Don't You Get This Information from the IRS?"

We appreciate the suggestion to use ﬁnancial information provided by taxpayers to the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) for

responses to the ACS. However, information from the IRS are not as current as the information we collect. The Census Bureau

uses data from other government agencies for research and evaluations to improve our surveys and censuses, reduce survey

costs, decrease respondent burden, and to better understand the information we are collecting. We also use this information to
help develop estimates of the population between census years. The Census Bureau cannot rely solely on other agencies' data
instead of your responses for several reasons:

First, these data-called administrative records-do not contain the data for everyone.

Second, we cannot obtain all of the required data from administrative records.
Third, data may not be usable because of differences in collection periods or deﬁnitions.

We designed the ACS to provide up-to-date information for federal and state agencies. For more information on the Census
Bureau's use of administrative data, visit the Combining Data [https://www.census.gov/about/what/admin-data.html] and Data
Linkage [https://www.census.gov/datalinkage] pages.

Questions as they appear on the form

We ask two questions that cover each type of income that you receive, as well as your total
income. These statistics create a proﬁle of the type and distribution of income in a community.

Income data help communities:

Provide Adequate Housing

We ask about income and housing costs to understand whether housing is affordable in local communities. When housing is not
sufﬁcient or not affordable, income data helps communities:

Enroll eligible households in programs designed to assist them.
Qualify for grants from the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnership Program, Emergency Solutions

Grants (ESG), Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA), and other programs.

Provide Assistance to Older Americans

We calculate poverty status and ask about age and disability status to help communities ensure older people receive appropriate
assistance, such as ﬁnancial assistance with utilities (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program).

Provide Assistance to Children and Families

We ask about income, the number and age of children in families, and health insurance status to help communities enroll

eligible families in programs designed to assist them. Income data determines eligibility and funding in programs like

Medicaid, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, and Head Start.

Educate Children and Adults

School districts make long-term building, stafﬁng, and funding decisions based on how many children and adults depend
on services. We calculate poverty status and ask about school enrollment, disability status, and language spoken at home

to qualify schools for grants that help fund programs for students with needs for additional services or assistance
(including free/reduced price school lunches) (Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965).

Plan Community Development

We ask about income, employment, and housing costs to qualify communities for loan and grant programs designed to:

Stimulate economic recovery.
Improve housing.
Run job training programs.
Define areas as empowerment or enterprise zones.

History of income questions

Income questions originated with the 1940 Census, as a way to understand the ﬁnancial situation of Americans in the

wake of the Great Depression. After undergoing years of testing, they were transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it
replaced the decennial census long form. In 2019, modiﬁcations were made to questions about retirement income.

Research about this modiﬁcation [https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2017/acs/2017_Posey_01.html] and
copies of previous questionnaires [https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaire-

archive.2018.html] are available on the ACS website.
