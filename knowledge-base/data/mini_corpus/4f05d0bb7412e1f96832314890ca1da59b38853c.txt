Vintage of Geographic Areas for ACS Estimates

The ACS typically publishes estimates using the latest available geographic boundaries (also known as "vintages").

For ACS 5-year estimates, use the last year of the estimate period to determine the vintage. For example, the following

datasets use the same vintages of geographic boundaries:

2023 ACS 1-year estimates

2019-2023 ACS 5-year estimates

To learn more about geographic concepts used in the ACS, check out our geographic handbook Geography and the
American Community Survey: What Data Users Need to Know [/programs-

Legal Areas

Legally defined geographic areas used in the ACS are updated on an annual basis from a variety of programs,
including: the Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS) [/programs-surveys/bas.html] , the Redistricting Data Program
[/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo.html]  and the School District Review Program [/programs-

areas are designed to have stable boundaries over time.

The U.S. Census Bureau collects congressional and state legislative districts every two years through the

Redistricting Data Program. Typically, new geography products are generated only when changes to congressional or

state legislative districts are reported between sessions. For more information see: Redistricting Data Program
[/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo.html] .

Changes to the boundaries of legal areas may cause complementary changes to the boundaries of selected

statistical areas.

/3

While the American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
definitions of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas; in certain instances, the names, codes, and boundaries

of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB definitions due to differences in the effective
dates of the geographic entities.

/4

The 2023 ACS data products for Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs), also referred to as Metropolitan and
Micropolitan Statistical Areas, are based on post-2020 Census revised delineations published by the Office of

Management and Budget (OMB) on July 21, 2023 (OMB Bulletin No. 23-01 [https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-
content/uploads/2023/07/OMB-Bulletin-23-01.pdf] ). For more information see: Metropolitan and Micropolitan
