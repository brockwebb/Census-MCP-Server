We ask questions about whether a person lives with his/her

grandchildren under age 18, if he/she is the primary caregiver,

and how long he/she has cared for his/her grandchildren to

create statistics about grandparent caregivers.

Grandparent caregiver data help federal agencies understand

the special provisions needed for federal programs designed to

assist families, as older Americans are often in different

ﬁnancial, housing, and health circumstances than those of

other ages. These data also help measure the effects of

policies and programs that focus on the well-being of families,

including tax policies and ﬁnancial assistance programs.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci
and law enforcement.

Question as it appears on the form

We ask one question about whether adults live with their grandchildren under 18, and if they are

Grandparents as caregivers data help communities:

Provide Assistance to Families

We want to know more about families, particularly those where grandparents care for grandchildren, along with data about the

ages of children, household income, disability, and poverty status. This information helps communities enroll eligible families in

programs designed to assist them, such as the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and helps communities qualify for

grants to fund these programs. These data are also used to evaluate programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families

(TANF).

Provide Assistance to Older Americans

Local ofﬁcials use information about how many people in a community are over a certain age, including whether older Americans

are caring for grandchildren, to fund programs and services targeted to reach older adults with the greatest economic and social
needs (Older Americans Act).

Understand Changing Households

Information about how often grandparents are responsible for the basic care for grandchildren and how long they have been

responsible in combination with information about age, disability, income, etc., helps communities understand if available housin
and services are meeting residents' needs.

History of grandparents as caregivers question

The grandparents as caregivers question originated with the 2000 Census. It was transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it replace
the decennial census long form.
