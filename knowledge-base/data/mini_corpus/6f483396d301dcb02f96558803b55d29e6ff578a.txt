We ask questions about a person's military service and

service-connected disability rating to create estimates of

veterans and their needs at the community level.

Data about veterans help plan and fund government programs

that provide assistance or services for veterans and evaluate

other government programs and policies to ensure they fairly

and equitably serve the needs of veterans.

These statistics are also used to enforce laws, policies, and regulations against discrimination in society. Though the U.S.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) maintains veterans' records, these statistics do not provide federal program planners,

policymakers, and researchers with additional statistics about all veterans, regardless of whether they use VA services.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th
data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen
entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci

and law enforcement.

Questions as they appear on the form

We ask three questions about active duty service, the period of active duty, and service-
connected disability status and rating to create a proﬁle of our nation's veterans.

Veteran data help communities:

Administer Programs for Veterans

We want to know more about the numbers and characteristics of veterans eligible for federal programs beneﬁting veterans, such

as:

VA Home Loan Guarantee program.
Post-9/11 GI Bill.
Job training and hiring preference programs.

This information helps communities and the federal government estimate the future demand for these programs and services.

These data are also used to evaluate these programs to determine whether they are beneﬁting veterans as intended.

Provide Health Care for Veterans

Local communities and the federal government want to know about the number of veterans eligible to use VA health care in

combination with age, disability, and service-connected disability ratings, to estimate the future demand for health care services
and facilities. Communities in need of major VA medical facilities throughout the country make a case for new construction projec

using these data to estimate the expected usage of new facilities.

Plan End-of-Life Options for Veterans

Information about where veterans are living toward the end of their lives is important, as the VA estimates the number of nursing

home and domiciliary beds needed based on the concentrations of eligible veterans over age 65. These data are also important
for the VA National Cemetery Administration, whose goal is to have a VA burial option within 75 miles of a veteran's residence.

These data are used to plan construction of new cemeteries near the communities where veterans choose to live.

Ensure Equal Opportunity

We want to know about the veteran and service-connected disability rating status of people in the community in combination with

information about housing, employment, and education, to help the government and communities enforce against discrimination
based on veteran or disability status.

Understand New Challenges for Veterans

Information about the characteristics of veterans returning to civilian life is also important to combat speciﬁc problems they may
face. For example, researchers use these data to understand why veteran status is a predictor of homelessness. Such data hav

been combined with administrative data produced by shelters in an attempt to understand and document which interventions
reduce homelessness among veterans.

History of veterans questions

The ﬁrst question related to veterans was included in the 1840 Census. Questions about veteran status and period of military
service were transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the decennial census long form. The current VA service-connected

disability rating question was added to the ACS in 2008.
