What Is Health Insurance Coverage?

Health insurance coverage in the Current Population Survey 
Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC) refers to 
comprehensive coverage at any time during the calendar year for 
the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States.* For 
reporting purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau broadly classifies health 
insurance coverage as private insurance or public insurance. 

Private Coverage

 • Employment-based: Plan provided through an employer or 

union.

 • Direct-purchase: Coverage purchased directly from an 

insurance company, or through a federal or state Marketplace  
(e.g., healthcare.gov).

 • TRICARE: Coverage through TRICARE, formerly known as 

Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services.

Public Coverage

 • Medicare: Federal program that helps to pay health care costs 
for people aged 65 and older and for certain people under the 
age of 65 with long-term disabilities.

 • Medicaid: This report uses the term Medicaid to include the 

specific Medicaid government program and other programs for 
low-income individuals administered by the states such as the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Basic Health 
Programs.

 • VA and CHAMPVA: Care provided by the Department of 

Veterans Affairs, the military, and the Civilian Health and Medical 
Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Additionally, people are considered uninsured if they only had 
coverage through the Indian Health Service (IHS), as IHS coverage 
is not considered comprehensive.

* Comprehensive health insurance covers basic health care needs. This definition 
excludes single service plans such as accident, disability, dental, vision, or 
prescription medicine plans.

INTRODUCTION

Health insurance offers a means 
for financing an individual’s 
health care expenses. Health 
insurance coverage provides 
access to medical care, protection 
from high unexpected costs, 
and more economic stability 
for people and families. While 
the majority of people in the 
United States have private health 
insurance, primarily through an 
employer, others obtain coverage 
through programs offered by the 
government. Yet some do not 
have health insurance coverage 
at all (refer to the “What Is Health 
Insurance Coverage?” text box).

Year-to-year, the prevalence of 
health insurance coverage and 
the distribution of coverage types 
may change due to economic 
trends, shifts in the demographic 
composition of the population 
(such as population aging), and 
policy changes that affect access 
to care. Economic changes 
include shifts in the labor market 
following the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Policy changes include updates to 
the Medicaid program in response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic or 
other economic or social forces. 
For example, Congress extended 
mandated continuous coverage 
for those with Medicaid through 
March 2023 in all states.1 

Using information collected by the 
Current Population Survey Annual 
Social and Economic Supplement 
(CPS ASEC), this report presents 
statistics on health insurance 
coverage in the United States 
in 2023 and changes in health 
insurance coverage rates between

if they held it at any time during 
the calendar year.2 

The CPS is the longest-running 
household survey conducted 
by the U.S. Census Bureau. The 
key purpose of the CPS ASEC is 
to provide timely and detailed 
estimates of economic well-
being, of which health insurance 
is an important part. The 
Census Bureau has integrated 
improvements to the CPS ASEC 
as the needs of data users and 
the health insurance environment 
have changed. The estimates in 
this report are based on data 
collected in the 2024 and earlier 
CPS ASECs.

1 A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the MOE in 
relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to 
and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. MOEs shown in 
this table are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights. 

2 The estimates by type of coverage are not mutually exclusive; people can be covered by 

more than one type of health insurance during the year.

3 Private health insurance includes coverage provided through an employer or union, 

coverage purchased directly, or TRICARE.

4 Public health insurance coverage includes Medicaid, Medicare, CHAMPVA (Civilian 

Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs), and care provided by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the military.

HIGHLIGHTS

 • In 2023, most people, 92.0 

percent or 305.2 million, had 
health insurance, either for 
some or all of the year (Table 1 
and Figure 1).

 • In 2023, private health 

insurance coverage continued 
to be more prevalent than 
public coverage, at 65.4 
percent and 36.3 percent, 
respectively.3 

 • Of the subtypes of health 

insurance coverage, 
employment-based insurance 
was the most common, 
covering 53.7 percent of the 
population for some or all of 
the calendar year, followed 
by Medicaid (18.9 percent), 
Medicare (18.9 percent), 
direct-purchase coverage 
(10.2 percent), TRICARE 
(2.6 percent), and VA and 
CHAMPVA coverage (1.0 
percent).4 

 • While the private coverage rate 
was statistically unchanged 
between 2022 and 2023, the 
employment-based coverage 
rate declined by 0.7 percentage 
points to 53.7 percent in 2023. 
At the same time, the rate 
of direct-purchase coverage 
increased by 0.3 percentage 
points to 10.2 percent in 2023.5 

 • The 2023 public coverage rate 
was not statistically different 
from the rate in 2022. Whereas, 
Medicare coverage increased 
by 0.2 percentage points to 
cover 18.9 percent of people.

 • The uninsured rate for children 
under the age of 19 increased 
by 0.5 percentage points to 
5.8 percent between 2022 and 
2023 (Figure 2).

ESTIMATES OF HEALTH 
INSURANCE COVERAGE IN 
THE UNITED STATES

This report classifies health 
insurance coverage into three 
different categories: overall 
coverage, private coverage, 
and public coverage (refer to 
the “What Is Health Insurance 
Coverage?” text box). In the CPS 
ASEC, people are considered 
insured if they were covered 
by any type of health insurance 
for some or all of the previous 
calendar year. People are 
considered uninsured if they 
were not covered by any type of 
insurance for the entire year.6 

In 2023, most people (92.0 
percent) had health insurance 

coverage at some point during 
the calendar year (Figure 1). That 
means 8.0 percent of people were 
uninsured for the entire calendar 
year. More people had private 
health insurance (65.4 percent) 
than public coverage (36.3 
percent).

Employment-based insurance 
was the most common subtype 
of health insurance in the civilian 
noninstitutionalized population 
(53.7 percent), followed by 
Medicaid (18.9 percent), Medicare 
(18.9 percent), direct-purchase 
insurance (10.2 percent), 
TRICARE (2.6 percent), and VA 
and CHAMPVA health care (1.0 
percent).7, 8

The percentage of people 
covered by health insurance did 
not change between 2022 and 
2023, nor were there statistically 
significant changes in overall 
private coverage or overall public 
coverage. 

Of the subtypes of private 
health insurance, employment-
based coverage decreased by 
0.7 percentage points between 
2022 and 2023. The percentage 
of people covered by direct-
purchase insurance increased 
by 0.3 percentage points to 10.2 
percent, and TRICARE coverage 
increased by 0.3 percentage 
points to 2.6 percent between 
2022 and 2023.9, 10 

Of the three subtypes of public 
health insurance, Medicare rates 
increased between 2022 and 
2023, while the Medicaid and 
VA and CHAMPVA rates did not 
have any significant change. The 
percentage of people covered 
by Medicare increased 0.2 
percentage points to 18.9 percent 
in 2023. This increase was in part 
due to growth in the number of 
people aged 65 and older.11, 12

HEALTH INSURANCE 
COVERAGE BY TYPE AND 
SELECTED CHARACTERISTICS 

adults may receive coverage 
through a parent or guardian’s 
plan up to the age of 25. 

Health Insurance Coverage  
by Age

Age is associated with the 
likelihood that a person has health 
insurance coverage, as well as 
with health coverage type. In 
general, older adults (aged 65 
and older) and children (under 
the age of 19) are more likely to 
have health insurance coverage 
than those aged 19 to 64, in part 
because their age makes them 
eligible for certain public health 
insurance programs. Medicare 
provides health coverage benefits 
for most adults aged 65 and older. 
Children under the age of 19 may 
qualify for coverage through 
Medicaid or the Children’s Health 
Insurance Program (CHIP).13 Since 
the implementation of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care 
Act (ACA), children and young 

For children under the age of 
19, the uninsured rate increased 
0.5 percentage points to 5.8 
percent in 2023. For adults aged 
65 and older, the uninsured rate 
(0.9 percent) was lower in 2023 
compared with 2022 (Figure 2). 

There were no statistical changes 
between 2022 and 2023 for the 
working-age adult age groups 
listed in Figure 2; however, 
uninsured rates differed between 
the age groups. Among working-
age adults, those aged 19 to 25 
had the highest rate (14.1 percent) 
uninsured for the entire calendar 
year of 2023, and those aged 
45 to 64 had the lowest (8.6 
percent). Overall, the uninsured 
rate for adults decreased as age 
increased. 

Private Coverage
Private coverage rates varied by 
broad age groups (Figure 3). In 
2023, the percentage of working-
age adults aged 19 to 64 with 
private coverage was 73.1 percent, 
compared with 61.2 percent of 
children under the age of 19 and 
45.2 percent of those aged 65 
and older. Among adults aged 
19 to 64, most had employment-
based coverage (62.9 percent 
of all working-age adults). In 
2023, 23.1 percent of adults aged 
65 and older had employment-
based coverage, and 19.5 percent 
had coverage they purchased 
directly.14 

Between 2022 and 2023, private 
coverage for children under 19 
years old did not statistically 
change, but employment-based 
coverage for children decreased 
1.0 percentage point during this 
period. For working-age adults 
aged 19 to 64, private coverage

change, although direct-

by 0.6 percentage points (to 9.2 
percent), and TRICARE coverage 
increased by 0.2 percentage 
points (to 2.4 percent).15 Among 
those 65 years and older, 
TRICARE coverage increased 0.5 
percentage points. 

Public Coverage 
In 2023, more than one third 
of children under the age of 
19 had public health coverage 
(36.2 percent), compared with 
18.9 percent of adults aged 19 
to 64. Most adults 65 years and 
older (93.8 percent) held public 
coverage. Among children under 
the age of 19, 35.7 percent were 
covered through Medicaid or 
CHIP; among adults aged 65 and 
older, 93.7 percent were covered 
through the Medicare program. 
About 15.9 percent of working-
age adults aged 19 to 64 were 
covered through Medicaid, and 
3.4 percent held Medicare at 
some point in the year.

Between 2022 and 2023, public 
coverage types saw little change 
by age group. VA and CHAMPVA 
coverage decreased for adults 
65 years and older (by 0.6 
percentage points). No other 
changes in public health coverage 
by age group occurred between 
2022 and 2023.

Uninsured Rates for Children 
and Working-Age Adults by 
Selected Characteristics

In general, most adults aged 65 
and older are covered by health 
insurance, primarily through 
Medicare. For children under the 
age of 19 and working-age adults 
aged 19 to 64, health insurance 
coverage status and coverage 
type vary. While people 65 years 

and older have nearly universal 
access to Medicare, those under 
the age of 65 are more likely to 
be uninsured and more likely to 
have variability in their type and 
continuity of coverage over time.

Children Under the Age of 19
In 2023, 5.8 percent of children 
under the age of 19 did not have 
health insurance, an increase of 
0.5 percentage points since 2022. 
Health insurance coverage rates 
for children under the age of 19 
in 2023 differed across several 
demographic factors including 
race and Hispanic origin (Figure 
4). In 2023, Hispanic children 
(of any race) had the highest 
uninsured rate at 9.4 percent. 
Asian children had an uninsured 
rate of 4.2 percent, non-Hispanic 
White children had an uninsured 
rate of 4.4 percent, and Black 
children had an uninsured rate of 
4.8 percent.16, 17, 18 None of these 
rates were statistically different 
from 2022.

In 2023, 5.1 percent of children 
under the age of 19 born in the 
United States were uninsured. In 
contrast, 19.2 percent of foreign-
born children were uninsured, 
including 7.5 percent of children 
who were naturalized citizens and 
22.1 percent of children who were 
not citizens. These rates were not 
statistically different from 2022.19 

The uninsured rate varied by 
region of the United States as 
well. For children under the age of 
19 in the Midwest, the uninsured 
rate increased from 3.3 percent 
in 2022 to 4.6 percent in 2023, 
an increase of 1.3 percentage 
points. In the West, the uninsured 
rate for children increased by 0.9 
percentage points to 5.1 percent. 
However, the uninsured rate 
did not significantly change for 

children in the South (7.6 percent) 
or children in the Northeast (4.1 
percent).20 

The ACA provides the option 
for states to expand Medicaid 
eligibility to people whose 
income-to-poverty ratio falls 
under a particular threshold. 
As of January 1, 2023, 38 states 
and the District of Columbia had 
expanded Medicaid eligibility 
requirements (referred to 
as “expansion states”). The 
remaining 12 states had not 
expanded Medicaid eligibility 
(“nonexpansion states”). The 
uninsured rate for children under 
the age of 19 living in Medicaid 
expansion states increased 
to 4.6 percent in 2023. For 
children in nonexpansion states, 
no significant change in the 
uninsured rate occurred between 
2022 and 2023, which was 8.3 
percent in 2023.

Working-Age Adults 19 to 64 
Years Old
Working-age adults (aged 19 to 
64) may have different health 
insurance outcomes from other 
age groups because they do 
not qualify for certain programs 
intended for children, such as 
CHIP. Some other programs, such 
as Medicare, are widely available 
to adults aged 65 and older, but 
working-age adults only qualify 
under limited circumstances. 
In 2023, 10.9 percent of adults 
aged 19 to 64 did not have health 
insurance coverage (Figure 5). 

At 23.6 percent, the uninsured 
rate of Hispanic adults (of any 
race) aged 19 to 64 was about 
twice the rate for Black adults (11.1 
percent), and more than twice 
the rate for non-Hispanic White 
adults (7.0 percent), and for Asian 
adults (6.8 percent).21

8 Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2023 

U.S. Census Bureau

  
  
      
  
The uninsured rate for foreign-
born working-age adults was 
more than 2.5 times the rate of 
native-born working-age adults 
(22.3 percent compared with 
8.1 percent). Among foreign-
born adults aged 19 to 64, 32.9 
percent of noncitizen adults were 
uninsured in 2023, more than 
three times the percentage of 
naturalized citizens who were 
uninsured (9.5 percent).

The uninsured rates of working-
age adults by race, Hispanic 
origin, and nativity were not 
statistically different between 
2022 and 2023.

For many adults aged 19 to 64, 
health insurance coverage is 
related to employment status, 
such as working full-time, year-
round; working less than full-
time, year-round; or not working 
at all. Between 2022 and 2023, 
the uninsured rate for adults 
aged 19 to 64 who worked full-
time, year-round increased by 
0.5 percentage points, from 8.4 
percent to 8.9 percent, while 
the uninsured rate for those 
who worked less than full-time, 
year-round decreased by 0.9 
percentage points, from 13.8 
percent to 12.9 percent. Working-
age adults who did not work had 
an uninsured rate of 14.7 percent 
in 2023.22 

Marital status is also related to 
health insurance coverage, as 
many married adults share their 
health plans. Among working-
age adults in 2023, the uninsured 
rates for those who were 
separated (18.1 percent), never 
married (14.7 percent), divorced 
(11.6 percent), or widowed (10.5 
percent) were higher than the 
uninsured rate for those who 
were married (7.9 percent). 

Between 2022 and 2023, only 
the uninsured rate for widowed 
adults aged 19 to 64 statistically 
changed, decreasing from 13.7 
percent to 10.5 percent.23, 24

Health insurance rates for adults 
aged 19 to 64 also varied by 
region. For example, 8.1 percent 
of adults living in the Midwest 
in 2023 were uninsured, a 0.9 
percentage-point increase from 
2022 (7.2 percent). The uninsured 
rate did not significantly change 
for working-age adults in other 
regions.

For adults aged 19 to 64, health 
insurance coverage may be 
related to both poverty status and 
residence in an expansion state.25 

The uninsured rates for adults 
aged 19 to 64 by income-to-
poverty group were lower in 
expansion states compared with 
nonexpansion states. In 2023, 
the uninsured rate for adults 
aged 19 to 64 was 8.9 percent 
in expansion states, compared 
with 15.5 percent in nonexpansion 
states (Figure 6). Overall, the 
uninsured rate for working-age 
adults increased in expansion 
states by 0.5 percentage points 
and remained unchanged in 
nonexpansion states between 
2022 and 2023.

For working-age adults in 
expansion states, there was a 1.0 
percentage-point increase in the 
uninsured rate for those between 
100 and 399 percent of their 
poverty threshold (13.3 percent in 
2023). 

For working-age adults in 
poverty in nonexpansion states, 
the uninsured rate fell by 5.3 
percentage points between 
2022 and 2023. This is based on 
a relatively small sample of 12 

nonexpansion states. The small 
sample size of the nonexpansion 
population in poverty may 
contribute to the large variances 
surrounding estimates for this 
group. No statistical changes in 
the uninsured rates occurred for 
other income-to-poverty groups 
in nonexpansion states.

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HEALTH 
INSURANCE COVERAGE BY 
SELECTED CHARACTERISTICS

The CPS ASEC can also be used 
to look more closely at health 
insurance coverage types for 
selected economic, demographic, 
and social characteristics. 
Examining changes in health 
coverage by type also highlights 
how these changes affect the 
uninsured rate for different 
groups.

Coverage Type for Children 
and Working-Age Adults by 
Household Income Quintile

Health insurance coverage and 
type is associated with household 
income, which may determine 
the ability to afford private health 
insurance, and those with low 
incomes may qualify for public 
health insurance options. Further, 
policies implemented in 2020 
in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic may have increased 
access to and the affordability 
of public and private health 
coverage, including Medicaid 
continuous coverage provisions 
that extended into 2023. 

Household income quintiles are 
created by ordering all households 
by income and then dividing them 
into five equally sized groups. 
Income cutoffs are determined 
by finding the income levels that 
ensure 20 percent of households 
are in each group. In 2023,

households in the lowest quintile 
had incomes of $33,000 or less. 
Households in the second quintile 
had incomes over $33,000 and 
up to $62,200; those in the third 
quintile had incomes over $62,200 
and up to $101,000; and those in 
the fourth quintile had incomes 
over $101,000 and up to $165,300. 
Households in the highest quintile 
had incomes over $165,300. 
Figure 7 presents health insurance 
for people in households by these 
income quintiles.26 

Uninsured rates and income 
quintiles have an inverse 
relationship. People in the lowest 
household income quintile had 
the highest uninsured rates, both 

for children under the age of 19 as 
well as for adults aged 19 to 64. 
As the income quintile increased, 
the percentage of uninsured 
decreased. Among working-
age adults, those in the lowest 
household income quintile had 
an uninsured rate of 21.2 percent, 
while those in the highest income 
quintile had an uninsured rate of 
3.8 percent in 2023. 

In 2023, 10.3 percent of children 
under the age of 19 (or about 1 
million) living in households in 
the lowest income quintile did 
not have health insurance at any 
time, and 6.6 percent of children 
(or about 987,000) living in 
households in the third quintile 

did not have health insurance. 
However, for children living in 
households in the highest income 
quintile, the uninsured rate was 
2.5 percent (about 497,000 
children) in 2023.27 

Among people in the lowest 
quintile, the private health 
insurance coverage rates were 
16.6 percent for children under 
the age of 19 and 30.3 percent 
for working-age adults aged 19 to 
64. Households in higher quintiles 
had higher rates of private 
insurance. Those in the highest 
income quintile households were 
the most likely to have private 
health insurance (91.8 percent 
for children under the age of 19

and 92.6 percent for working-age 
adults). 

In contrast, those in the lowest 
income quintile were the most 
likely to have public insurance 
(77.0 percent for children under 
the age of 19 and 51.4 percent for 
working-age adults), while those 
in the highest quintile households 
were the least likely to have public 
health insurance (7.0 percent 

for children under the age of 19 
and 5.3 percent for working-age 
adults). The percentage of people 
with public insurance decreased 
as the household income quintile 
increased. 

Coverage Type by 
Demographic and Social 
Characteristics

Among people of all ages, 
differences in coverage type and 

changes in coverage can be seen 
across demographic and social 
groups (Figure 8). For example, 
coverage rates varied by race and 
Hispanic origin. In 2023, non-
Hispanic White individuals had the 
highest rate of private coverage 
(72.3 percent), followed by 
Asian individuals (71.4 percent), 
Black individuals (55.9 percent), 
and Hispanic individuals (49.5 
percent). For public coverage,

1 Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. Therefore, two basic ways of defining a 
race group are possible. A group, such as Asian, may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the 
race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race 
(the race-alone-or-in-combination concept). This figure shows estimates for the race-alone population.

12 Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2023 

U.S. Census Bureau

Black individuals had the 
highest public coverage rate of 
42.3 percent in 2023, followed 
by Hispanic individuals (37.2 
percent), non-Hispanic White 
individuals (35.5 percent), and 
Asian individuals (29.2 percent).

Private and public coverage rates 
also varied by nativity status. In 
2023, 67.4 percent of native-born 
individuals had private coverage, 
compared with 54.4 percent of 
foreign-born individuals. The 
public coverage rate for native-
born individuals was 36.9 percent 
in 2023. 

Private coverage rates decreased 
by 0.7 percentage points in 
expansion states between 2022 
and 2023. In 2023, 65.9 percent 
of people in expansion states 
had private coverage, and 37.8 
percent had public coverage. No 
significant year-to-year changes 
occurred for either private or 
public coverage in nonexpansion 
states. In nonexpansion states 
in 2023, 64.2 percent of people 
had private coverage, while 33.0 
percent had public coverage.

When looking at health insurance 
by work experience, disability 
status, or marital status, the 
population of interest includes 
adults aged 19 to 64. 

For many adults aged 19 to 64, 
health insurance coverage is 
related to work status, as many 
workers may be covered by their 
employers’ health plans. Indeed, 
private health insurance coverage 
rates for workers were higher 
than for nonworkers. In 2023, 
84.7 percent of full-time, year-
round workers and 67.0 percent of 
those working less than full-time, 

year-round were covered through 
a private insurance plan. By 
comparison, those who did not 
work at all had the lowest rates of 
private health insurance coverage, 
at 46.7 percent. No statistically 
significant year-to-year changes in 
rates of private coverage occurred 
for either workers or nonworkers.

Rates of public coverage followed 
a different pattern. Nonworkers 
were more likely than workers 
to have public coverage (42.8 
percent of nonworkers and 12.6 
percent of workers). Full-time, 
year-round workers had the 
lowest rate of public coverage at 
8.6 percent, while 23.8 percent of 
workers who worked less than full-
time, year-round were covered by 
public coverage in 2023.

Among adults aged 19 to 64, 
those with a disability were less 
likely than those with no disability 
to have private health insurance 
coverage and were more likely 
to have public coverage. In 2023, 
47.9 percent of working-age 
adults with a disability had private 
coverage, compared with 75.2 
percent with no disability. At the 
same time, 51.2 percent of adults 
aged 19 to 64 with a disability and 
16.1 percent with no disability had 
public coverage.

There were also differences in 
the distribution of coverage type 
by marital status. For example, 
in 2023, 81.8 percent of married 
adults aged 19 to 64 had private 
coverage, compared with 64.0 
percent of those who were not 
married. Married adults were 
also less likely to hold public 
coverage (13.6 percent) than their 
nonmarried counterparts (24.5 
percent). 

ESTIMATES OF HEALTH 
INSURANCE COVERAGE: 2013 
TO 2023

Overall Coverage Rate

Economic trends, demographic 
shifts, and changes in federal and 
state policy provide important 
context for coverage levels 
and changes within social and 
demographic groups. The 
uninsured rate declined from 2013 
to 2014, when many provisions 
of the ACA went into effect and 
continued to decline through 
2016, then remained at 8.8 
percent in 2017 under the legacy 
processing system (Figure 9).28 

After switching to the new 
processing system, the 2017 rate 
was 7.9 percent. From 2017 to 
2018 the uninsured rate increased 
to 8.5 percent. The uninsured 
rate in 2020 (8.6 percent) was 
not significantly different from 
the uninsured rate in 2018.29 
The CPS ASEC only considers 
people who had no coverage at 
all during the calendar year as 
uninsured. Therefore, people who 
lost health insurance coverage in 
2020 because of the COVID-19 
pandemic were not considered 
uninsured in 2020 in the CPS 
ASEC. In 2021, the uninsured 
rate declined by 0.4 percentage 
points from 2020, to 8.3 percent. 
Between 2021 and 2022, the 
uninsured rate decreased by an 
additional 0.4 percentage points, 
falling to 7.9 percent in 2022. 
Between 2022 and 2023, there 
was no significant change, and 
the uninsured rate remained near 
historic lows at 8.0 percent in 
2023.

SUMMARY

In 2023, the overall uninsured 
rate did not change, nor did the 
overall rates of public or private 
coverage. 

There were changes in some 
types of insurance for the total 
population. For example, Medicare 
rates increased by 0.2 percentage 
points due to population aging. 
Employment-based insurance 
decreased by 0.7 percentage 
points, while direct-purchase 
insurance and TRICARE insurance 
each increased by 0.3 percentage 
points. Overall, private coverage 
continued to be more prevalent 
than public insurance.30

People in some social and 
demographic groups saw their 
uninsured rates change between 

2022 and 2023. The uninsured 
rate for children under the age of 
19 increased by 0.5 percentage 
points, driven by a 1.0 percentage-
point decrease in employment-
based insurance for this group. 
Conversely, the uninsured rate 
for adults 65 years and older 
decreased by 0.2 percentage 
points. 

ACCESSING HEALTH 
INSURANCE COVERAGE DATA 

State and Local Estimates of 
Health Insurance Coverage

The Census Bureau publishes 
annual estimates of health 
insurance coverage by state and 
other smaller geographic units 
based on data collected in the 
American Community Survey 
(ACS). Single-year estimates are 

available for geographic units with 
a population of 65,000 or more. 
Five-year estimates are available 
for all geographic units, including 
census tracts and block groups.

The Census Bureau’s Small Area 
Health Insurance Estimates 
(SAHIE) program also produces 
single-year estimates of health 
insurance for all states and 
counties. These estimates are 
based on statistical models using 
data from a variety of sources 
including current surveys, 
administrative records, and annual 
population estimates. In general, 
SAHIE estimates have lower 
variances than ACS estimates but 
are released later because they 
incorporate these additional data 
into their models.

SOURCE AND ACCURACY OF 
THE ESTIMATES

The CPS is the longest-running 
survey conducted by the Census 
Bureau. The CPS is a household 
survey primarily used to collect 
employment data. The sample 
universe for the basic CPS 
consists of the resident civilian 
noninstitutionalized population 
of the United States. People in 
institutions, such as prisons, long-
term care hospitals, and nursing 
homes, are not eligible to be 
interviewed in the CPS. Students 
living in dormitories are included 
in the estimates only if information 
about them is reported in an 
interview at their parents’ home. 
Since the CPS is a household 
survey, people who are homeless 
and not living in shelters are not 
included in the sample.

The CPS ASEC, the source for the 
estimates in this report, collects 
data in February, March, and 
April each year, asking detailed 
questions categorizing income 
into over 50 sources. The key 
purpose of the survey is to 
provide timely and comprehensive 
estimates of income, poverty, 
and health insurance and to 
measure change in these national-
level estimates. The survey is 
the official source of national 
poverty estimates calculated 
in accordance with the Office 
of Management and Budget’s 
Statistical Policy Directive 14.

The CPS ASEC collects data in 
the 50 states and the District 
of Columbia; these data do not 
represent residents of Puerto Rico 
or the U.S. Island Areas.31 The 
2024 CPS ASEC sample consists 
of about 89,500 addresses. 
The CPS ASEC includes military 
personnel who live in a household 
with at least one civilian adult, 
regardless of whether they live 
on- or off-post. All other armed 
forces personnel are excluded. 
The estimates in this report 
are controlled to March 2024 
independent national population 
estimates by age, sex, race, and 
Hispanic origin. Beginning with 
the data for 2020, population 
estimates are based on 2020 
Census population counts and are 
updated annually after accounting 
for births, deaths, emigration, and 
immigration.

The estimates in this report (which 
may be shown in text, figures, and 
tables) are based on responses 
from a sample of the population 
and may differ from actual values 
because of sampling variability 
or other factors. As a result, 
apparent differences between the 

U.S. Census Bureau 

Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2023  15

estimates for two or more groups 
may not be statistically significant. 
All comparative statements have 
undergone statistical testing and 
are statistically significant at the 
90 percent confidence level unless 
otherwise noted.

In this report, the variances of 
estimates were calculated using 
replication methods. For estimates 
prior to 2010, or as noted in 
historical tables, the Generalized 
Variance Function method 
was used. More information 
on replicate weights, standard 
errors, income top-coding and 
data swapping on the public-
use file, and changes to the CPS 
ASEC data file from the prior year 
is available at <https://www2.
census.gov/programs-surveys/
cps/techdocs/cpsmar24.pdf>.

Nonresponse Bias in the CPS 
ASEC

The Census Bureau administers 
the CPS ASEC each year between 
February and April by telephone 
and in-person interviews, with 
most data collected in March. In 
2020, normal data collection was 
interrupted due to the COVID-
19 pandemic. The response 
rate fell to 73 percent in March 
2020, down from 82 percent in 
March 2019. Response rates were 
regularly above 80 percent before 
the pandemic. 

Although standard collection 
procedures have resumed, 
response rates remain lower than 
they were before the pandemic. 
The response rate for the CPS 
basic household survey was 67 
percent in March 2024. Lower 
response rates could affect 
estimates if respondents differ 
from nonrespondents. More 
information on how sample 

differences and nonresponse 
bias affected income and 
poverty estimates in the 2024 
CPS ASEC is available at <www.
census.gov/newsroom/blogs/
research-matters/2024/09/
administrative-data-nonresponse-
bias-cps-asec.html>. Information 
on how data collection issues in 
2020 affected health insurance 
coverage estimates is available 
at <www.census.gov/library/
working-papers/2020/demo/
SEHSD-WP2020-13.html>. 

CPS ASEC Modernization

The Census Bureau has begun 
a multiyear effort to modernize 
many of its surveys, including the 
CPS. Part of this involves adding 
an Internet Self-Response (ISR) 
mode to the CPS and then the 
CPS ASEC. 

This project requires extensive 
review and testing to ensure 
that ISR is a viable collection 
mode for the CPS ASEC and that 
changes do not negatively affect 
the reliability and comparability 
of the estimates. The project 
schedule seeks to align the CPS 
ASEC modernization effort 
with that of the CPS to maintain 
continuity. However, the schedule 
and activities may change to 
accommodate funding availability, 
discovery of issues during 
testing and analysis, and project 
reprioritization.

ASEC modernization project 
and timeline, visit the Census 
Bureau’s CPS ASEC Modernization 
Efforts webpage at <www.

and care provided by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) and the military.
8 In 2023, the percentage of people with 
Medicare coverage was not statistically 
different from the percentage of people 
with Medicaid coverage.
9 Given the small sample size and relative 
stability in enrollment reported by the 
Military Health System, it is difficult to 
determine whether the apparent increase 
in the CPS ASEC between 2022 and 2023 
reflects real change in TRICARE coverage. 
For more information, refer to the Annual 
Evaluation of the TRICARE Program, <www.

purchase coverage was not statistically 
different from the percentage-point change 
of people with TRICARE coverage.
11 The proportion of the population 65 years 
and older with Medicare coverage did not 
statistically change between 2022 and 
2023. The percentage of the U.S. population 
65 years and older, however, increased 
between 2022 and 2023.
12 Between 2022 and 2023, the percentage-
point change of people with Medicaid 
coverage was not statistically different 
from the percentage-point change of 
people with Medicare coverage or the 
percentage-point change of people with VA 
and CHAMPVA coverage.
13 CHIP is a public assistance program that 
provides health insurance to children in 
families with income too high to qualify 
for Medicaid, but who are likely unable to 
afford private health insurance.
14 Although most people aged 65 and 
older held coverage through Medicare, 
47.6 percent of people aged 65 and older 
reported holding more than one type of 
coverage concurrently for some or all of 
calendar year 2023.
15 Between 2022 and 2023, the percentage-
point change of adults aged 19 to 64 with 
private coverage was not statistically 
different from the percentage-point change 
of adults aged 19 to 64 with direct-purchase 
coverage or the percentage-point change 
of adults aged 19 to 64 with TRICARE 
coverage.

16 Federal surveys give respondents the 
option of reporting more than one race. 
Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race 
group are possible. A group, such as Asian, 
may be defined as those who reported 
Asian and no other race (the race-alone 
or single-race concept) or as those who 
reported Asian regardless of whether they 
also reported another race (the race-alone-
or-in-combination concept). The body of 
this report (text and figures) shows data 
using the first approach (race alone). 
Primary use of the single-race population 
does not imply that it is the preferred 
method of presenting or analyzing data. 
The Census Bureau uses a variety of 
approaches. In this report, the terms “White, 
not Hispanic” and “non-Hispanic White” are 
used interchangeably and refer to people 
who are not Hispanic and who reported 
White and no other race. This report uses 
non-Hispanic White as the comparison 
group for other race and Hispanic origin 
groups. Since Hispanic individuals may be 
any race, data in this report for the Hispanic 
population overlap with data for race 
groups. Of those who reported only one 
race, Hispanic origin was reported by 17.1 
percent of White householders, 5.8 percent 
of Black householders, 2.4 percent of Asian 
householders, and 32.3 percent of American 
Indian and Alaska Native householders. 
Data users should exercise caution when 
interpreting aggregate results for the 
Hispanic population or for race groups 
because these populations consist of many 
distinct groups that differ in socioeconomic 
characteristics, culture, and nativity. Data on 
Hispanic origin were first collected in 1972. 
Data on Asian and Pacific Islander origin 
and American Indian and Alaska Native 
origin were first collected in 1987. More 
information is available at <www.census.
gov/programs-surveys/cps.html>. 
17 The small sample size of the Asian 
population and the fact that the CPS ASEC 
does not use separate population controls 
for weighting the Asian sample to national 
totals contribute to the large variances 
surrounding estimates for this group. As 
a result, the CPS ASEC may be unable to 
detect statistically significant differences 
between some estimates for the Asian 
population.
18 In 2023, the percentage of Black 
children under the age of 19 without 
health insurance was not statistically 
different from the percentage of Asian 
children under the age of 19 without health 
insurance.
19 In 2023, the percentage of native-born 
children under the age of 19 without health 
insurance was not statistically different 
from the percentage of naturalized citizen 
children under the age of 19 without health 
insurance.

20 In 2023, the percentage of children under 
the age of 19 without health insurance in the 
Midwest, the percentage of children under 
the age of 19 without health insurance 
in the Northeast, and the percentage of 
children under the age of 19 without health 
insurance in the West were not statistically 
different from each other.
21 In 2023, the percentage of non-Hispanic 
White working-age adults without health 
insurance was not statistically different 
from the percentage of Asian working-age 
adults without health insurance.
22 Between 2022 and 2023, the percentage-
point change in the uninsured rate for 
adults aged 19 to 64 who did not work 
was not statistically different from the 
percentage-point change in the uninsured 
rate for adults aged 19 to 64 who worked 
full-time, year-round or the percentage-
point change in the uninsured rate for 
adults aged 19 to 64 who worked less than 
full-time, year-round.
23 The small sample size of working-age 
adults who are widowed may contribute to 
the large variances surrounding estimates 
for this group.
24 In 2023, the percentage of widowed 
working-age adults without health 
insurance was not statistically different 
from the percentage of divorced working-
age adults without health insurance.
25 The Office of Management and Budget 
determined the official definition of poverty 
in Statistical Policy Directive 14. Appendix 
A of “Poverty in the United States: 2023,” 
provides a more detailed description of 
how the Census Bureau calculates poverty. 
More information is available at <www.

26 Dollar amounts are rounded to four 
significant digits.
27 Numbers rounded to the nearest 
thousand.
28 Figure 9 includes a series break after 
2017 when an updated processing system 
was introduced for the CPS ASEC. For 
more information on the processing system 
change, refer to Rachel A. Lindstrom, 
Katherine Keisler-Starkey, and Lisa N. 
Bunch, “Estimates of Health Insurance 
Coverage, 2013 to 2022,” SEHSD Working 
Paper Number 2023-27, U.S. Census 
Bureau, Washington, DC, 2023.
29 Comparisons between 2018 and 
2020 estimates use 2010 Census-based 
population controls.
30 Between 2022 and 2023, the percentage-
point change of people with direct-
purchase coverage, the percentage-point 
change of people with Medicare coverage, 
and the percentage-point change of 
people with TRICARE coverage were not 
statistically different from each other. 
31 U.S. Island Areas include American Samoa, 
Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

1 A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable 
the estimate. This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. MOEs shown in this table 
are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights. 

2 Private health insurance includes coverage provided through an employer or union, coverage purchased directly, or TRICARE.
3 Public health insurance coverage includes Medicaid, Medicare, CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of 

Veterans Affairs), and care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the military.

4 Individuals are considered to be uninsured if they did not have health insurance coverage for the entire calendar year.
5 Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are 
possible. A group, such as Asian, may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as 
those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows 
data using the first approach (race alone). The use of the single-race population does not imply that it is the preferred method of presenting 
or analyzing data. The Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches. Data for American Indians and Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Other 
Pacific Islanders, and those reporting two or more races are not shown separately.  

6 Children under the age of 19 are eligible for Medicaid/CHIP.
7 This age group is of special interest because of the Affordable Care Act’s dependent coverage provision. Individuals aged 19 to 25 may be 

eligible to be a dependent on a parent’s health insurance plan.

8 Medicaid expansion status as of January 1, 2023. Expansion states on or before January 1, 2023 include AK, AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DC, DE, HI, 
IA, ID, IL, IN, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MT, ND, NE, NH, NJ, NM, NV, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, UT, VA, VT, WA, and WV. For more information, 
refer to <www.medicaid.gov/state-overviews/index.html>.

Note: The estimates by type of coverage are not mutually exclusive; people can be covered by more than one type of health insurance during 

the year.

1 A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable 
the estimate. This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. MOEs shown in this table 
are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights. 

2 Private health insurance includes coverage provided through an employer or union, coverage purchased directly, or TRICARE.
3 Public health insurance coverage includes Medicaid, Medicare, CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of 

Veterans Affairs), and care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the military.

4 Individuals are considered to be uninsured if they did not have health insurance coverage for the entire calendar year.
5 The sum of those with and without a disability does not equal the total because disability status is not defined for individuals in the U.S. armed 

forces. 

6 The combined category “married” includes three individual categories: “married, civilian spouse present,” “married, U.S. armed forces spouse 

present,” and “married, spouse absent.” 

Note: The estimates by type of coverage are not mutually exclusive; people can be covered by more than one type of health insurance during 

the year.
