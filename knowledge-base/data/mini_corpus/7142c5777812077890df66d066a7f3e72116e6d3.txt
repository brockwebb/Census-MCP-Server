USING THE CENSUS DATA API WITH  
THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY:  
WHAT DATA USERS NEED TO KNOW 

An API, or “Application Programming Interface,” is a 
tool that programmers can use to access data more 
efficiently. It reduces the need for data storage and 
provides software developers, data scientists, and oth-
ers with a set of standard commands to easily access 
statistics that can be incorporated into their programs 
and applications. 

This guide provides an overview of the Census Data 
API and how it can be used to access data from the 
U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 
(ACS), a source of up-to-date statistics on the social, 
economic, housing, and demographic characteristics of 
America’s communities.

The guide is intended for software developers and 
researchers who want to access ACS data to create 
mobile- or Web-based apps, as well as nonprogram-
mers who want to create simple queries to access ACS 
data through an Internet browser.

More detailed instructions on how to use the Census 
Data API are available in the Census Bureau’s Census 
Data API User Guide.1

What Is the American Community 
Survey?

The ACS is a nationwide survey designed to provide 
communities with reliable and timely social, economic, 
housing, and demographic data every year. A sepa-
rate annual survey, called the Puerto Rico Community 
Survey (PRCS), collects similar data about the popu-
lation and housing units in Puerto Rico. The Census 
Bureau uses data collected in the ACS and the PRCS 
to provide estimates on a broad range of population, 
housing unit, and household characteristics for states,

<www.census.gov/data/developers/guidance/api-user-guide.html>. 

counties, cities, school districts, congressional districts, 
census tracts, block groups, and many other geo-
graphic areas.

The ACS has an annual sample size of about 3.5 million 
addresses, with survey information collected nearly 
every day of the year. Data are pooled across a calen-
dar year to produce estimates for that year. As a result, 
ACS estimates reflect data that have been collected 
over a period of time rather than for a single point in 
time as in the decennial census, which is conducted 
every 10 years and provides population counts as of 
April 1 of the census year.

ACS 1-year estimates are data that have been col-
lected over a 12-month period and are available for 
geographic areas with at least 65,000 people. Starting 
with the 2014 ACS, the Census Bureau is also produc-
ing “1-year Supplemental Estimates”—simplified ver-
sions of popular ACS tables—for geographic areas with 
at least 20,000 people. The Census Bureau combines 
5 consecutive years of ACS data to produce multiyear 
estimates for geographic areas with fewer than 65,000 
residents. These 5-year estimates represent data col-
lected over a period of 60 months. 

For more detailed information about the ACS—how 
to judge the accuracy of ACS estimates, understand-
ing multiyear estimates, knowing which geographic 
areas are covered in the ACS, and how to access ACS 
data on the Census Bureau’s Web site—see the Census 
Bureau’s handbook on Understanding and Using 
American Community Survey Data: What All Data 
Users Need to Know.2

U.S. Census Bureau1. OVERVIEW OF THE CENSUS DATA API

The Census Data API is a data service that enables 
developers, data scientists, and others to access and 
use statistical data from the American Community 
Survey (ACS), decennial census, Population Estimates 
and Projections, County Business Patterns, and many 
other U.S. Census Bureau programs. The Census 
Bureau’s Web site provides a complete list of data sets 
available through the Census Data API.3 

Why Use the Census Data API? 

The Census Data API has a simple interface. It provides 
an efficient way to get ACS and other data directly 
from the Census Bureau, without storing the data on a 
computer or a local server. If you know how to read the 
documentation and create a request, you can easily 
download variables and geographic areas of interest. 
Data are continuously available and regularly updated, 
so you have immediate access to new data as it is 
released. 

The Census Data API makes it easy to access ACS 
data, but for novice users, the amount of data avail-
able can be overwhelming. The ACS covers over 40 
different topics and releases thousands of tables.4 
Developers can help make the ACS data more acces-
sible by building programs using statistical software 
like R and Python, creating mobile and Web apps, and 
developing interactive data visualizations that display 
data directly in an app or browser window in an easily 
consumable format.

Examples of Census Bureau applications that draw 
ACS data directly from the Census Data API include 
My Tribal Area and My Congressional District.5 

The Census Data API is also used widely by organiza-
tions outside of the Census Bureau. 

For example, the Pennsylvania State Data Center uses 
the API to produce a series of dashboards based on 
ACS estimates, and Cleargov.com uses the Census 
Data API and other sources to produce online profiles 
of cities and towns for state and local governments.6

ACS Data Sets Available Through the 
Census Data API

The Census Data API currently includes the following 
ACS data sets:

•  ACS 1-Year Estimates: Data for geographic areas 
with populations of 65,000 or more. Covers a 
broad range of topics about social, economic, 
housing, and demographic characteristics of the 
U.S. population.7

•  ACS 5-Year Estimates: Data available down to the 
block-group level.8 Covers a range of topics about 
social, economic, housing, and demographic char-
acteristics of the U.S. population.9

•  ACS Migration Flows: Data on the movement of 

people between counties, minor civil divisions, 
and metropolitan statistical areas using ACS 
5-year estimates. Flows are crossed by selected 
characteristics.10

•  ACS 1-Year Supplemental Estimates: Simplified ver-

sions of popular ACS tables for geographic areas 
with populations of 20,000 or more.11

•  The Planning Database: Data File with selected 

variables from the 2010 Decennial Census and ACS 
5-year estimates at the block group and census 
tract levels.12

Within the ACS 1-year and 5-year data sets, five differ-
ent collections of data are available. “Profiles” contain 
some of the most commonly used ACS statistics, while 
“Tables” provide more detailed tabulations of ACS 
estimates: 

•  Detailed Tables: Include the most detailed cross-
tabulations of ACS data, many of which are pub-
lished down to the block-group level. There are 
over 31,000 variables in this data set.

U.S. Census Bureau•  Data Profiles: Include profiles of social, economic, 

housing, and demographic characteristics for areas 
down to the census tract level. Data are presented 
as both counts and percentages. There are over 
1,000 variables in this data set.

•  Comparison Profiles: Include ACS data for the 
nation, states, counties, places, congressional 
districts, and metropolitan/micropolitan statis-
tical areas with populations of 5,000 or more. 
Comparison Profiles are similar to Data Profiles 
but include comparisons with past-year data and 
statistical significance testing. There are over 1,000 
variables in this data set.

•  Subject Tables: Include estimates covering specific 
topics—such as age, commuting characteristics, 
educational attainment, and marital status—for 
geographic areas down to the census tract level. 
The data are presented as both counts and per-
centages. There are over 16,000 variables in this 
data set.

for areas with large populations and for large 
population subgroups.

Finding the Data Set and Variables You 
Need

With all the data sets available in the Census Data 
API, finding the one you need can be challenging. The 
Census Data API Discovery Tool can help you make 
sense of all this information.13 A complete list of avail-
able data sets is available on the Census Bureau’s Web 
site in HTML format.14 Users can also navigate to spe-
cific data sets from the Developers Web page.15 

To find a particular data set, you can scroll through the 
list or search within your Web browser for a specific 
year or phrase (for example, “2016” or “ACS 5-Year”). 
If you click on the link for “geographies” for the 2016 
ACS 5-Year Detailed Tables, you can see a list of the 
87 geographic areas available for that data set (see 
Figure 1.1). 

•  Selected Population Profiles: Include estimates 
covering social, economic, housing, and demo-
graphic data. Data are available for over 100 racial, 
ethnic, tribal, ancestry, and country/region of birth 
groups. These profiles are generally only available

U.S. Census BureauOthers may find it useful to search for variables within 
“groups” to classify variables based on the published 
ACS tables from which they are drawn. For example, 
in Figure 1.3, the third row provides a link to selected 
variables available from ACS Table B01001: Sex by 
Age. The next section describes how you can use the 
“groups” function to select multiple ACS variables with 
a single API query.

The Census Data API Discovery Tool is also available 
in Extensible Markup Language (XML) and JavaScript 
Object Notation (JSON) formats for more advanced 
data users who want to access the metadata (the 
descriptive information or documentation about the 
data sets) in machine-readable formats.17

U.S. Census Bureau2. WORKING WITH THE CENSUS DATA API

The U.S. Census Bureau has produced an API User 
Guide and organized a Webinar to help developers and 
researchers access and use the Census Data API to 
request data from Census Bureau data sets.18 Key infor-
mation from these resources is summarized below.

API Key

Any user may query small quantities of data with 
minimal restrictions (up to 50 variables in a single 
query, and up to 500 queries per IP address per day). 
However, more than 500 queries per IP address per 
day requires that you register for an API key. 

To request an API key:

•  Go to <www.census.gov/developers/>.

18 U.S. Census Bureau, Developers, Census Data API User Guide, 
<www.census.gov/data/developers/guidance/api-user-guide.html>; 
American Community Survey (ACS), Using the Census API with the 
American Community Survey Webinar, <www.census.gov/data 
/academy/webinars/2019/api-acs.html>. 

•  Click on the Request a KEY box on the left side of 

the page.

•  Fill out the form: <https://api.census.gov/data 

/key_signup.html>.

•  You will receive an email with your key code and 

activation instructions in the message.

Once you have an API key, you can extract information 
from Census Bureau data sets using a variety of tools 
including JSON, R, Python, or even by typing a query 
string into the URL of a Web browser.19

Components of an API Query

Each API call, or query, requires a series of compo-
nents to function properly. Figure 2.1 provides an 
example of an API call and its components. 

19 Users may not be able to view the results from API queries in all 

Web browsers, but Firefox and Chrome provide this functionality.

6   What Data Users Need to Know

U.S. Census BureauWith the API, you access only the variables and geo-
graphic areas that you need. In the query above:

•  The “Census Data API” specifies the API that is 

being used to access the data. 

•  The “Dataset” specifies the data source is the 2016 

ACS 1-Year Detailed Tables. 

•  The “Get Function” (get=) specifies the variable(s) 

you are requesting the API to give you. 

•  The “Variable List” includes the variable(s) you are 

requesting. You can include up to 50 variables in 
a single API query (separated by commas). In this 
data set, the variable called NAME provides the 
name of the geographic area(s) that you are using 
to limit your search.

•  The “Predicate” clause specifies how variables 

should be filtered or limited (for example, for cer-
tain geographic areas).

• 

“Geography” specifies the geographic area(s) of 
interest.

Understanding Variable Names

Each variable in a data set has a name, which may 
have meaning on its own (for example, TRACT for 
census tract, or NAME for geographic area name) or 
may be an alpha-numeric identifier. In the American 
Community Survey (ACS), many of the variable names 
are alpha-numeric, such as B01003_001E, which is the 
Total Population. The “Variable List” column on the 
Census API Datasets Web page provides links to all the 
variables in each data set.20

The first letter in an ACS variable’s name indicates the 
table type. For example, a “B” at the beginning of a 
name indicates that data are from a “base” table and 
“C” is for a collapsed table. The collapsed tables cover 
the same topics as the base tables, but with fewer 
details.21 

The next five digits in an ACS variable name refer to 
the rest of the summary table identifier (ID). The first 
two digits are a subject identifier and the next three

descendants, <https://api.census.gov/data.html>.

21 Detailed information about ACS table IDs is available on the 
Census Bureau’s Table IDs Explained Web page at <www.census.gov 
/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/which-data-tool/table-ids-explained 
.html>.

are a sequential number. Tables beginning with “01,” 
for example, are for age and sex, “08” tables are com-
muting (journey to work) and place of work.22 The next 
three digits reflect the table number within a subject.

Some variables end in “A” through “I,” which tells you 
that the corresponding ACS table provides character-
istics that are repeated for different race and Hispanic 
origin groups. For example, table numbers ending in a 
“C” are for American Indian and Alaska Native Alone 
populations. Table numbers with an “H” suffix are for 
non-Hispanic White populations. For example, Table 
B01001H is Sex by Age (White Alone, Not Hispanic or 
Latino).

Other tables end in “PR,” which tells you that the data 
came from the Puerto Rico Community Survey instead 
of the ACS. These Puerto Rico-specific tables exist 
because the wording of the Puerto Rico Community 
Survey questionnaire for some subjects differs slightly 
from the ACS questionnaire.

The six-character table ID is followed by an underscore 
and three more digits. Those three digits refer to the 
line number within a table. For example, “001” may 
refer to the total, “002” may refer to males, and so on.

Finally, the last character in an ACS variable is an 
alphabetical suffix (E, M, PE, or PM). 

• 

• 

• 

• 

“E” refers to a numeric representation of the ACS 
estimate. 
“M” refers to a numeric representation of the mar-
gin of error. 
“PE” refers to an estimate representing a percent 
of the total. 
“PM” refers to the margin of error for a percentage. 

In some data sets, users may also see variables ending 
with "EA," "MA," “PEA,” “PMA,” or “SS.” These suffixes 
are special annotations used to communicate informa-
tion about estimates, margins of error, or statistical 
significance. For example, “SS” refers to “Statistical 
Significance” and is only included in the Comparison 
Profile tables. When extracting data for ACS estimates 
or margins of error, it is important to also extract the 
data for any special annotations.  

22 Data Profiles, Narrative Profiles, Comparison Profiles, and 

Selected Population Profiles cover multiple topics, so they do not have 
any characters to indicate a subject.

What Data Users Need to Know   7

U.S. Census BureauSuppose you needed an estimate of the male popula-
tion aged 5 to 9. Those data are located in Table B01001: 
Sex by Age. Data for males aged 5 to 9 appear within 
that table on line 4. Finally, estimates are designated by 
an “E.” Thus, the variable string to include in your API 
query would be B01001_004E (see Figure 2.2). 

For more information about variable formats, types, 
and annotations, see the Census Bureau’s Notes on 
ACS 5-Year Data.23

U.S. Census BureauFiltering Geography

In an API query, you can use a “predicate” to filter your 
ACS results by geography: 

•  The “for” predicate (&for) restricts the variables by 

geography at various levels.

•  The “in” predicate (&in) restricts the geographic 
scope and can be used in combination with a “+” 
sign to further specify a geographic area of interest.

An asterisk can be included as a wildcard to search for 
all the values of a geographic area or a string variable; 
however, you cannot build a predicate with wild-
cards for numeric variables. Table 2.1 provides several 

examples of predicates of geography you can use 
when building your queries.

Every query must include a geography. The Census 
Data API supports Federal Information Processing 
Series (FIPS) codes and Geographic Names 
Informational System (GNIS) codes. You may look 
up codes for certain geographic areas on the Census 
Bureau’s Geography Web page.24 You can also easily 
find specific codes by using the wildcard with a geo-
graphic level of interest in the API.

U.S. Census BureauFor example, to retrieve data from Table B01001_001E 
(total population) for all states, use the following the 
string: 

<https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?get=NAME 
,B01001_001E&for=state:*> 

The results of this query are displayed in Figure 2.3.

Source: U.S. Census Bureau, <https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?get=NAME,B01001_001E&for=state:*>.

The results shown in Figure 2.3 are in JavaScript Object 
Notation (JSON) format. JSON, like XML, is a simple 
format for exchanging data between platforms using 
human-readable language. In order to return results in 
a concise manner, the Census Bureau uses a nonstan-
dard, streamlined version of JSON: 

•  Data are represented in a two-dimensional array.

•  Square brackets [ ] hold arrays. 

•  Values are separated by commas (,).

•  The first line of data contains the variable names.

•  Each subsequent line of data is a record for a given 

geography.

Data users familiar with JSON can convert results into 
a standard JSON format using the following code snip-
pet:

```js

let standardJSON =  
 <fetch stats async with promise> 
  .then(data => {  
      let labels = data[0].map(datum => datum.toUpperCase());  
      let rows = data.slice(1);  
      let objArray = rows.map(row => { return Object.assign(  

{}, 
 ...labels.map((key, idx) => ({ [key]: row[idx] }))  

           ); 
        });

To query 2016 total population only for Alabama (01), 
California (06), and Rhode Island (44), we could use 
the following string:

<https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?get=NAME
,B01001_001E&for=state:01,06,44>.

In this example, the predicate “for” is used to limit the 
search to Alabama (state code = 01), California (state 
code = 06), and Rhode Island (state code = 44). (See 
Figure 2.4).

To query 2016 total population for counties included 
in the 2016 ACS 1-year data set for California (06), we 
could use the following string:

<https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?get=NAME
,B01001_001E&for=county&in=state:06>. 

Note that certain predicates will result in an error 
(“unknown/unsupported geography hierarchy”) if 
the specified geographic area is not available in the 
data set. For example, estimates for small geographic 
areas with fewer than 20,000 people are only available 
through the ACS 5-year data.

The predicate “for” limits the search to counties, 
and the “in” term limits the search to California 
(&in=state:06). (See Figure 2.5).

U.S. Census BureauGroups

You can include up to 50 variables in a single API 
query, but it is possible to query more than 50 vari-
ables with a single call using the “groups” function. 
For example, to query all elements from Table B01001 
(Sex by Age, for the United States) from the 2016 ACS 
1-year data, you would use the following string:

That query returns all elements of the Sex by Age 
Table, with variable names in the first line and data in 
subsequent lines (see Figure 2.6).

For more information about groups, visit the Census 
Bureau’s Web page on Groups Functionality.25

U.S. Census BureauSample Query: Hmong Population by 
State

Suppose you needed information on the Hmong 
population living in each state. How would you use the 
Census Data API to get that information?

There are many ACS data sets available through the 
Census Data API. For this example, we focus on the 
ACS 1-Year Detailed Tables because we need state-
level data for the most recent year. 

Figure 2.7 provides an example of an API call and its 
components that could be used for this query. 

Figure 2.7. Components of API Query for Hmong Population by State: 2016

Source: U.S. Census Bureau, <https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?get=NAME,B02015_009E,B02015_009M&for=state:*>.

Here are steps you can use to assemble the 
components of this query:

variable, B02015_009M, to get the margin of error: 
"https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?get 

1.  Start your query with the Census Data API Web 

=NAME,B02015_009E,B02015_009M." 

address: "https://api.census.gov/data."

2.  Add the data set year (2016) and name acronym 

for the 1-Year Detailed Tables, and follow this base 
URL with a question mark:  
"https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?."

3.  Add variables starting with a get clause, "get=": 

"https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?get=."

4.  Add the variable NAME, which provides the name 
of the geographic area(s) that you will use to limit 
your search: 
"https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs 
/acs1?get=NAME."

5.  Find your variable of interest (B02015_009E) by 

searching for “Hmong” among the list of variables 
for the 2016 ACS 1-Year Detailed Tables.26 

6.  Use a comma to separate the NAME and 

B02015_009E variables. Add an additional 

7.  Add geography using a predicate clause starting 

with an ampersand (&) to separate it from your 
“get” clause and then a “for=” to identify geo-
graphic areas of interest:  
"https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?get 

=NAME,B02016_009E,B02015_009M&for=."

8. 

Identify the geographic area(s) that you need 
(state) by reviewing the list of geographies avail-
able for the 2016 ACS 1-Year Detailed Tables.27

9.  Because you need data for all the states, add an 
asterisk (after a colon) to get all state values: 
"https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1?get 
=NAME,B02015_009E,B02015_009M&for=state:*."

If you are using an API key, insert “&key=” followed by 
your key code at the end of your query.

U.S. Census BureauThe results of the query are shown in Figure 2.8. In this 
figure, some of the data cells for Alaska and Delaware 
include “null” values. This means that there are no data 
available for a particular query. 

If your query returns an error message with no data, 
check your spelling, capitalization, and spacing. 
Correct any errors and run the query again.

U.S. Census BureauGetting Data for Detailed Population 
Groups

Suppose you also wanted to get information on 
the percentage of Hmong Americans with a bach-
elor’s degree or higher. You could use the Selected 
Population Profile (SPP) data set to find this informa-
tion for the nation and for states with relatively large 
populations of Hmong Americans.

In this query:

•  The “spp?” identifier is included to query results 
from the Selected Population Profile data set. 

•  S0201_0006E is the variable for total population, 
POPGROUP is the code for the population group, 
and POPGROUP_TTL is the name of the popula-
tion group, as shown in the list of variables for the 
2016 ACS 1-Year Selected Population Profile.28  

The first step is to find a code that we can use to 
identify the Hmong subpopulation in the SPP data set. 
Here is a sample query:

By scrolling through the results of this query, we find 
that the POPGROUP code for the Hmong alone popu-
lation is “020” (see Figure 2.9).

U.S. Census BureauNow that we know the code for the Hmong population, 
we can get data on the share of Hmong Americans 
with a bachelor’s degree or higher nationwide:

<https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/spp?get 
=S0201_0099E,POPGROUP,POPGROUP_TTL,NAME&f
or=us:*&POPGROUP=020>.    

Here is a similar query for states:

<https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/spp?get 
=S0201_0099E,POPGROUP,POPGROUP_TTL,NAME 
&for=state:*&POPGROUP=020>.    

The results from the U.S. query show that 18 percent of 
Hmong Americans aged 25 and older had a bachelor’s 
degree or higher in 2016. Because of the relatively 
small Hmong population in many states, state-level 
SPP data on the Hmong population are only available 
for California and Minnesota (see Figure 2.10).

You can find other examples of queries for this data set 
by clicking the link in the “Examples” column on the 
API “datasets” page, which will take you to the exam-
ples page here: <https://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs 
/acs1/spp/examples.html>.
