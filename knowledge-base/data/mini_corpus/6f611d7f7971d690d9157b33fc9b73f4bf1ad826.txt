We ask questions about the units in the structure, number of

rooms, and number of bedrooms to create data about housing

types and housing density.

Local, state, tribal, and federal agencies use these data in

government programs to analyze whether adequate housing is

available and affordable for residents, and to provide and fund

housing assistance programs. The number of rooms in

combination with the number of people living in a unit provides

a ratio of people to rooms, which can be used to measure the

extent of overcrowding in our nation's households. These

statistics also help enforce laws, policies, and regulations

against discrimination in government programs and in society.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen
entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci
and law enforcement.

Questions as they appear on the form

We ask two questions about the units in the structure, number of rooms, and number of
bedrooms to produce statistics about housing types and housing density.

Results from these questions

We compile the results from these questions to provide communities with important statistics for infrastructure development and

emergency planning. You can see some of these published statistics here for the nation, states, and your community.

Units in structure, rooms, and bedrooms data help communities:

Provide Adequate Housing

We ask about different types of housing, and how many people occupy that housing, to help communities understand whether

available housing meets the needs of residents. For example, these data help measure overcrowding in communities and are

integral components to set Fair Market Rents for all areas of the country.

When housing is not sufﬁcient, data can help communities:

Enroll eligible households in programs designed to assist them (such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program).
Qualify for grants from the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships Program, Emergency Solutions

Grants (ESG), Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA), and other programs.

These data provide benchmark statistics that measure progress toward the Congressional declaration of goals for a national
housing policy--a decent home and suitable living environment for every American family.

Plan Community Development

These data are used to identify adequate housing and may be useful in identifying types of structures in disaster-prone areas
during emergency planning and preparation.

History of units in structure, rooms, and bedrooms questions

Units in structure and rooms originated with the 1940 Census, while bedrooms originated with the 1960 Census. They were

transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the decennial census long form.
