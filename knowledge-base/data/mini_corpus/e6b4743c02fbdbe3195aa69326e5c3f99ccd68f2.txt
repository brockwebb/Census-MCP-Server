Household Income in States and Metropolitan 
Areas: 2023

American Community Survey Briefs

By Katherine Engel and Kirby G. Posey

ACSBR-023

September 2024

INTRODUCTION

This brief presents statistics on median household 
income and the Gini index of income inequality based 
on the 2023 (and earlier) American Community 
Survey (ACS), 1-year estimates and the Puerto Rico 
Community Survey (PRCS).1 This brief examines a 
historical time series of median household income 
back to 2005 and analyzes changes in median 
household income between 2022 and 2023 for the 
nation, states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, 
and the 25 most populous metropolitan areas. It also 
includes selected demographic characteristics of the 
householder. Changes in the Gini index between 2022  
and 2023 are presented for the nation, states, the 
District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

The ACS data (including the PRCS) provide detailed 
estimates of demographic, social, economic, and hous-
ing characteristics for states, congressional districts, 
counties, places, and other localities every year.2 The 
ACS is described in more detail in the text box “What 
Is the American Community Survey?”

The ACS is conducted monthly, with income data 
collected for the 12 months preceding each interview. 
Income estimates from the 2023 ACS are based on 
responses collected during 2023. This information 

1 The U.S. Census Bureau has reviewed this data product to 

ensure appropriate access, use, and disclosure avoidance protection 
of the confidential source data used to produce this product (Data 
Management System [DMS] number: P-7533841, Disclosure Review 
Board [DRB] approval number: CBDRB-FY24-0138). All comparative 
statements have undergone statistical testing and are statistically 
significant at the 90 percent confidence level, unless otherwise noted.

may reflect income received in some months of 
2022. References to income estimates in 2023 in 
this brief correspond to estimates from the 2023 
ACS. Therefore, comparing the 2022 ACS with 
the 2023 ACS is not an exact comparison of the 
economic conditions in 2022 with those in 2023, and 
comparisons should be interpreted with caution.3

HIGHLIGHTS

•  Median household income increased in three 
states (Florida, Nebraska, and Vermont) and 
decreased in four states (Alaska, Delaware, Georgia, 
and Pennsylvania) from 2022 after adjusting 
for inflation. Forty-three states, the District of 
Columbia, and Puerto Rico showed no statistically 
significant differences.

•  Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Maryland had the 
highest median household income of all states 
($99,858, $99,781, and $98,678, respectively) and 
were not statistically different from each other. 
The median household income ($108,210) for the 
District of Columbia was the highest in the nation. 
Mississippi had the lowest median household 
income ($54,203) of any state.

•  Income inequality measured by the Gini index 

increased in three states (Alaska, Delaware, and 
Georgia) and decreased in ten states (Alabama, 
California, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, 
Missouri, New York, North Dakota, and West 
Virginia) between the 2022 and the 2023 ACS.

MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD 
INCOME: 2022 AND 2023 
NATIONAL AND STATE 
COMPARISONS

The U.S. median household income 
was $77,719, according to the ACS 
(Table 1). There was no statistically 
significant change in real median 
household income in the United 
States between the 2022 ACS and 
the 2023 ACS.4 Figure 1 shows 

4 “Real” refers to income after adjusting 

for inflation. All income estimates in this 
report are inflation-adjusted to 2023 dollars. 
Inflation adjustments are computed using 
the Consumer Price Index retroactive series 
using current methods (R-CPI-U-RS).

Household  income:  Includes  income  of  the  householder and all 
other people 15 years and older in the household, whether or not 
they are  related to the householder.

Median: The point that divides the household income distribution 
into halves, one-half with income above the median and the other 
with income below the median. The median is based on the income 
distribution of all households, including those with no income.

Gini index: A summary measure of income  inequality. The Gini index 
varies from 0 to 1,  with 0 indicating perfect equality, where there 
is a proportional distribution of income. A Gini  index of 1 indicates 
perfect inequality, where  one household has all the income.

a historical series of median 
household income back to 2005.5

Massachusetts, New Jersey, 
and Maryland had the highest 
median household incomes of 
all states ($99,858, $99,781, and 
$98,678, respectively); there 
was no statistical difference 

5 Due to data collection challenges 

related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 
ACS data were not released and are not used 
in this report. Year-to-year comparisons were 
only made between years with standard data 
collection and were not made between 2019 
and 2020, and between 2020 and 2021. For 
more information on the 2020 experimental

among the three. The District of 
Columbia’s median household 
income ($108,210) was the highest 
in the nation. Mississippi had the 
lowest median household income 
($54,203) of any state. Puerto 
Rico’s median household income 
in 2023 was $25,621 (Table 1 and 
Figure 2). Median household 
income was lower than the  
U.S. median in 28 states and 
Puerto Rico. It was higher than 
the U.S. median in 19 states and 
the District of Columbia. The 
medians for Arizona, Nevada, and 

North Dakota were not statistically 
different from the U.S. median.

Between the 2022 ACS and the 
2023 ACS, three states—Florida, 
Nebraska, and Vermont—showed a 
significant increase in real median 
household income. Four states—
Alaska, Delaware, Georgia, and 
Pennsylvania—showed a decrease 
in real median household income. 
Real median household income in 
2023 was not statistically different 
from the 2022 ACS for 43 states, 
the District of Columbia, and 
Puerto Rico (Table 1).

MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD 
INCOME: 25 MOST POPULOUS 
METROPOLITAN AREAS

Table 2 shows median household 
income for the 25 most populous 
metropolitan areas.6

6 Metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs 

or metro areas) are geographic entities 
delineated by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) or use by federal statistical 
agencies in collecting, tabulating, and 
publishing federal statistics. A metro area 
contains a core urban area with a population 
of 50,000 or more individuals. For more 
information, refer to <www.census.gov/
programs-surveys/metro-micro/about/omb-
standards.html>.

According to the 2023 ACS, 
median household income 
ranged from $127,792 in the San 
Francisco metro area to $72,574 
in the Detroit metro area.7 Median 
income increased between 2022 
and 2023 in the Houston, Miami, 
and Orlando metro areas. Median

household income decreased 
in the Atlanta, Detroit, and San 
Francisco metro areas. The 
remaining 19 metro areas did not 
have a statistically significant 
change between 2022 and 2023 
(Figure 3).

MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD 
INCOME: RACE AND HISPANIC 
ORIGIN OF HOUSEHOLDER

This brief uses the characteristics 
of the householder to describe 
the household. Characteristics 
of household members may 

be different from those of the 
householder.8 Table 3 shows 

median household income by 
race and Hispanic origin of the 
householder.

 8 The householder refers to the person (or 
one of the people) in whose name the hous-
ing unit is owned or rented (maintained) or, if 
there is no such person, any adult mem-
ber, excluding roomers, boarders, or paid 
employees. If the house is owned or rented 
jointly by a married couple, the house-
holder may be either spouse. The number 
of householders is equal to the number of 
households.

Median household income in 2023 
ranged from $111,817 for Asian 
households to $53,927 for Black 
households.9 Hispanic households 

9 Federal surveys give respondents the 

option of reporting more than one race. 
Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race 
group are possible. A group, such as Asian, 
may be defined as those who reported Asian 
and no other race (the race-alone or single-
race concept) or as those who reported 
Asian regardless of whether they also 
reported another race (the race-alone-or-
in-combination concept). This report shows 
data using the race alone approach. Use of 
the single-race population does not imply 
that it is the preferred method of presenting 
or analyzing data. The U.S. Census Bureau 
uses a variety of approaches. In this report, 
the terms “White, not Hispanic” and “non-
Hispanic White” are used interchangeably 
and refer to people who are not Hispanic and 
who reported White and no other race. Since 
Hispanic people may be any race, data in this 
report for Hispanic people overlap with data 
for race groups. Household income by race 
and Hispanic origin refers to the race and 
Hispanic origin of the householder. Race and 
Hispanic origin of household members may 
be different from those of the householder.

experienced a 1.3 percent 
increase in median household 
income between 2022 and 2023. 
White households experienced 
a decrease of 0.8 percent, and 
non-Hispanic White households 
fell by 0.7 percent. The change 
in median income for Asian and 
Black households between 2022 
and 2023 was not statistically 
significant. 

MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD 
INCOME: AGE OF 
HOUSEHOLDER

Median household income 
increased 2.4 percent and 0.5 
percent between 2022 and 2023 
for households with a house-
holder under the age of 25 and 
with a householder aged 25 to 44, 
respectively, as shown in Table 3. 

There was no statistically sig-
nificant change in median house-
hold income between 2022 and 
2023 for the other age groups. 
Households with a householder 
aged 45 to 64 had the high-
est median household income 
in 2023 ($94,612), followed by 
those with householders aged 25 
to 44 ($87,673), and those with 
householders 65 years and older 
($56,038). Households maintained 
by householders under the age of 
25 had the lowest median house-
hold income ($44,846).

in 2023 (0.483) was lower than in 
2022 (0.486). Between 2022 and 
2023, the ACS Gini index increased 
in three states: Alaska, Delaware, 
and Georgia. Ten states—Alabama, 
California, Florida, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri, 
New York, North Dakota, and  
West Virginia—had lower Gini 
index values than in 2022. Changes 
from 2022 were not statistically 

significant for the other 37 states, 
the District of Columbia, and Puerto 
Rico. 

New York had the highest Gini 
index among the 50 states. 
However, the Gini index for New 
York was not statistically different 
from the District of Columbia and 
was lower than Puerto Rico. Utah 
had the lowest Gini index (refer to 
Table 1 and Figure 4). There were 

five states with Gini index values 
higher than the U.S. index and 39 
states that were lower. Six states 
had Gini index values that were not 
statistically different from the  
U.S. index (Table 1 and Figure 4). 
From 2006 (the earliest year the 
Gini index is available) to 2023, the 
national Gini index increased 4.1 
percent, from 0.464 to 0.483.

SUMMARY

The U.S. median household income 
was statistically unchanged 
from 2022 to 2023. Between 
2022 and 2023, three states 
showed an increase in median 
household income. Four states 
showed a decrease. Median 
household income in 2023 was 
not statistically different from 
2022 for 43 states, the District of 
Columbia, and Puerto Rico. This 
brief also provided information 
on changes in median household 
income across metropolitan areas, 
race and Hispanic origin, and age 
of householders. The Gini index 
showed a decrease nationally and 
in ten states between 2022 and 
2023.

SOURCE AND ACCURACY

The data presented in this 
report are based on the ACS 
and PRCS samples interviewed 
from January 1, 2022, through 
December 31, 2022 (2022 ACS 
and 2022 PRCS), and January 1, 
2023, through December 31, 2023 
(2023 ACS and 2023 PRCS). The 
estimates based on these samples 
correspond to the average values 
of person, household, and housing 
unit characteristics over this 
period of collection. Sampling 
error is the uncertainty between 
an estimate based on a sample

WHAT IS THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY?

The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey 
designed to provide reliable and timely demographic, social, 
economic, and housing data for the nation,  states, congressional 
districts, counties, places, and other localities every year. It has an 
annual sample size of about 3.5 million  addresses across the United 
States and Puerto Rico and includes  both housing units and group 
quarters (e.g., nursing homes and prisons). The ACS is conducted in 
every county throughout the nation and in every municipio in Puerto 
Rico, where it is called the Puerto Rico Community Survey. Beginning 
in 2006, ACS data have been released annually for geographic 
areas with populations of 65,000 and greater. For information on 
the ACS sample  design  and  other  topics,  visit  <www.census.gov/

undergone statistical testing, 
and comparisons are significant 
at the 90 percent level, unless 
otherwise noted. In addition to 
sampling error, nonsampling error 
may be introduced during any 
of the operations used to collect 
and process survey data such 
as editing, reviewing, or keying 
data from questionnaires. For

NOTES

The Census Bureau also reports 
income estimates based on data 
from the Current Population 
Survey (CPS). The CPS is the 
Census Bureau’s longest-running 
household survey. The CPS Annual 
Social and Economic Supplement 

(ASEC) asks detailed questions 
categorizing income into over 
50 sources. The key purpose 
of the CPS ASEC is to provide 
timely and detailed estimates of 
income and to measure change 
in national-level estimates. The 
CPS ASEC is the official source 
of national poverty estimates. 
For more information from the 
CPS ASEC about national income 
estimates, refer to the report 
“Income in the United States: 
2023” at <www.census.gov/library/
publications/2024/demo/p60-282.
html>.

For information on income 
estimates from the ACS and how 
they differ from those based on 
the CPS ASEC, refer to “Fact 
Sheet: Differences Between the 
American Community Survey and 
the Annual Social and Economic 
Supplement to the Current 
Population Survey” at <www.
