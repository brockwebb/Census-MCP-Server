2016 American Community
Survey Content Test:
Computer and Internet Use

Written by: Jamie Lewis

From February to June of 2016, the U.S. Census Bureau conducted the 2016 American Community

Survey (ACS) Content Test, a field test of new and revised content. The primary objective was to test
whether changes to question wording, response categories, and definitions of underlying constructs

improve the quality of data collected. Both new and revised versions of existing questions were tested to

determine if they could provide data of sufficient quality compared to a control version as measured by a

series of metrics including item missing data rates, response distributions, comparisons with
benchmarks, and response error. The results of this test will be used to help determine the future ACS

content and to assess the expected data quality of revised questions and new questions added to the

ACS.

This report describes the results of the test for the revised versions of the Types of Computer, Internet
Access, and Internet Subscription questions.Â
