Metropolitan Areas: 2023

Written by: Craig Benson
Report Number: ACSBR-022

Poverty is an important indicator of economic well-being. Federal and state policymakers, as well as community

stakeholders often use poverty rates and income-to-poverty ratios as key indicators of current economic conditions

within communities and to make comparisons across demographic groups. Poverty rates, measured as the

proportion of people in poverty, are often used to identify communities in need and to estimate the number of families

eligible for various government programs.
