Instructions for Applying Statistical Testing 
to American Community Survey Data 

This document provides instructions on how to carry out statistical testing using American 
Community Survey (ACS) estimates.  Worked examples are provided in a separate document 
located at: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-
lists.html. 

Obtaining ACS Data 

ACS data may be found on data.census.gov.  Data users may wish to consult the data.census.gov 
training provided through the Census Academy, which is located at:  
https://www.census.gov/data/academy/topics/data-census-gov.html. 

See the sections “Creating Estimates and MOEs Using Microdata” and “Additional Methods to 
Obtain ACS Data” below for additional ways to obtain ACS data. 

Basic Statistical Test 

The test of statistical significance takes into account the difference between the two estimates as 
well as the standard errors of both estimates.  For two estimates, A and B, with standard errors 
SE(A) and SE(B), let 

The difference between A and B is significant at the 90 percent confidence level if: 

Z < -1.645  
or 
 Z > 1.645 

Otherwise, the difference is not significant at the 90 percent confidence level.  

This means that there is less than a 10 percent chance that the difference between these two 
estimates would be as large or larger by random chance alone.  

Converting ACS Margins of Errors to Standard Errors 

All published ACS estimates on data.census.gov include the 90 percent margin of error (MOE).   

To convert from the MOE to the standard error (SE) divide by 1.645. 

Standard Error = Margin of Error / 1.645

Note that some estimates are controlled to the official Population Estimates.  Data users will see 
five asterisks or stars (*****) in place of a number for the MOE.  For these estimates, set both 
the MOE and SE to zero (0). 

MOEs which have two or three stars or asterisks (** or ***) indicate that a statistical test is not 
appropriate. 

Note also that for ACS data from 2005 and earlier, 1.65 should be used instead of 1.645 when 
converting the MOE to the SE. 

Statistical Testing Tool 

The Census Bureau provides a tool for data users to carry out statistical testing.  Data users may 
compare two estimates to each other as well as comparing multiple estimates to one another.  
Data users do not need to convert MOEs to SEs.  The tool handles that automatically.    

The statistical testing tool may be found at:  https://www.census.gov/programs-
surveys/acs/guidance/statistical-testing-tool.html 

Notes on Carrying Out Statistical Testing 

1.  The Z-score listed above in the basic statistical test is the method used in determining 

statistical significance for the ACS Comparison Profiles published on data.census.gov.   

Note that data.census.gov publishes rounded estimates and MOEs.  However, the 
statistical testing for the Comparison Profiles is calculated using unrounded SEs.  
Therefore, statistical results using the published estimates may not match the published 
significance results. 

2.  Users may choose to apply a confidence level different from 90 percent to their tests of 
statistical significance.  For example, if Z < -1.96 or Z > 1.96, then the difference 
between A and B is significant at the 95 percent confidence level.   

How to convert the MOE from a 90 percent confidence level to a 95 percent confidence 
level may be found in the webinar entitled “Using American Community Survey (ACS) 
Estimates and Margins of Error” located at:  
https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/training-
presentations/20180418_MOE.pdf.  A transcript of the webinar may be found here: 
https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/training-
presentations/20180418_MOE_Webinar_Transcript.pdf. 

3.  The Z-score test can be used for any types of estimates, such as counts, percentages, 

proportions, means, medians, etc.  It can be used for comparing across years, or across 
surveys.  If one of the estimates is a fixed value or comes from a source without sampling

error (such as a count from the 2020 Census), use zero for the standard error for that 
estimate in the Z-score equation. 

4.  Making and interpreting comparisons between ACS single-year and multiyear estimates 

is very difficult and is not advised.   

5.  Using the rule of thumb of overlapping confidence intervals does not constitute a valid 

significance test and users should not use that method for determining whether estimates 
are statistically different from one another. 

Approximating Standard Errors for Derived Estimates 

Data users combining published estimates to create derived estimates will need to approximate 
the SE. 

Data users may use the MOE in place of the SE in the formulas below.  You do not need to 
convert from the MOE to the SE.   

If you multiply both sides of any of the SE formula below by 1.645, and then distribute, the 
formulas are mathematically equivalent whether you use MOE or SE. 

The formulas below are approximations that do not take include the correlation or covariance 
between the basic estimates.  They may be overestimates or underestimates of the derived 
estimate’s SE and MOE depending on whether the two basic estimates are highly correlated in 
either the positive or negative direction.  As a result, the approximations are not expected to 
match MOEs published on data.census.gov. 

1.  Sum or Difference of Estimates 

As the number of basic estimates involved in the sum or difference increases, the results 
of this formula become increasingly different from the standard error derived directly 
from the ACS microdata.  Care should be taken to work with the fewest number of basic 
estimates as possible.  If there are estimates involved in the sum that are controlled in the 
weighting then the approximate standard error can be tremendously different.   

2.  Proportions and Percentages 

Here we define a proportion as a ratio where the numerator is a subset of the 
denominator, for example the proportion of persons 25 and over with a high school 
diploma or higher. 

Let P = A / B.  Note that the proportion will range from zero to one. 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the value under the square root sign is negative, then instead use the formula below.  
Note that this is the same formula used for a ratio. 

For the special case where the proportion, P, equals 1 use 

Finally, to calculate a percentage, which ranges from 0% to 100%, simply multiply the 
proportion by 100.  That is, PCT = 100% × P.  To calculate the SE of the percent, 
multiply the SE of the proportion by 100%.  That is, SE(PCT) = 100% × SE(P). 

3.  Means and Other Ratios 

Ratios are similar to proportions.  However, the numerator is not a subset of the 
denominator.  The calculation of a mean may be considered a ratio.  Some other 
examples of ratios are persons per household and per capita income.  In addition, use this 
formula for calculating the SE of percent change. 

4.  Products 

For a product of two estimates - for example if users want to estimate a numerator by 
multiplying a percent by its denominator - the standard error can be approximated as: 

5.  Using Multiple Approximations 

Data users may need to use two or more approximations to obtain the SE or MOE for 
their estimate. 

For example, data users may need to combine several estimates to create their desired 
numerator and denominator before calculating a percent.  

For Example, let P = (A + B + C) / (D + E). 

4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before calculating the SE(P), you would first have to find SE(A+B+C) and SE(D+E).  
You would then use those SEs to calculate SE(P). 

Calculating Standard Errors Using Variance Replicate Estimates Tables 

For advanced users who want to obtain more accurate SEs or MOEs for derived estimates, the 
ACS provides Variance Replicate Estimate (VRE) tables.  These are augmented versions of 
published ACS detailed tables, for selected summary levels.  The VRE tables are only available 
for 5-year ACS data. 

Users may calculate SEs and MOEs of derived estimates with replicate estimates from the VRE 
tables using the same replicate variance methodology as the published ACS MOEs.  This 
replicate method incorporates the covariance between estimates that the approximation methods 
described above do not include.   

Data and technical documentation for the VRE tables may be found at: 
https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/variance-tables.html. 

A webinar on how to calculate MOEs using the replicate estimates in the VRE tables is located 
at: https://www.census.gov/data/academy/webinars/2020/calculating-margins-of-error-acs.html. 

Creating Estimates and MOEs Using Microdata 

Data users may wish to create estimates that are not available in an ACS data product.  They may 
do so by using the ACS Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS).  The PUMS files are a sample of 
the full ACS microdata with additional disclosure avoidance measures applied.  Data users may 
calculate their own estimates for individual characteristics.  In addition, MOEs and SEs may be 
calculated using either the replicate variance method or using a generalized variance formula 
(GVF) using design factors.  

Information on how to use PUMS data may be found on the PUMS technical documentation 
page: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html. 

Data users may also use the free online Microdata Analysis Tool (MDAT) tool to calculate 
PUMS estimates.  The tool is located at: https://data.census.gov/mdat/.
