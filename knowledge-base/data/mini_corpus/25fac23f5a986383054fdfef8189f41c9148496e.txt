We ask a question about the sex of each person to create

statistics about males and females and to present other data,

such as occupation, by sex.

Local, state, tribal, and federal agencies use data about males

and females to plan and fund government programs and

evaluate other government programs and policies to ensure

they fairly and equitably serve the needs of both populations.

These statistics also help enforce laws, regulations, and

policies against discrimination in government programs and in

society.

Data about males and females help communities:

Ensure Equal Opportunity

We ask about sex in combination with information about housing, language spoken at home, employment, and education, to hel

government and communities enforce laws, regulations, and policies against discrimination on the basis of sex. For example, da

about males and females help enforce laws against discrimination based on sex in education programs and activities receiving

federal ﬁnancial assistance (Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972).

Understand Changes

Researchers, advocacy groups, and policymakers are interested in knowing whether people of different sex have the same

opportunities in areas such as education, employment, and home ownership. For example, the National Science Foundation use

data by sex to provide information on women in the science and engineering workforce, and several agencies use this data to
investigate whether women, including women who are military veterans, have similar employment opportunities as men.

History of the sex question

The question about a person's sex originated with the 1790 Census. It was added to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the
decennial census long form.
