INTRODUCTION

In 2022, over 13 percent of the U.S. population had a 
disability.1 People with disabilities are more likely to 
face challenges, such as limited access to health care 
services and experience poorer health outcomes.2 
They are also more likely to face economic chal-
lenges such as unemployment and are at a higher risk 
of living in poverty.3 Understanding the prevalence 
of disability and the communities it affects is piv-
otal to addressing these economic and public health 
disparities. 

Within the population of people with disabilities, veter-
ans represent an important group, especially in terms 
of public health and public policy. In 2022, of the 16.2 
million American veterans in the United States, about 
5.4 million received compensation benefits because 
of a service-connected disability.4 In total, more than 
$112 billion was spent in 2022 on veterans’ disability 
compensation benefits.5

Compared with people who never served in the  
U.S. armed forces, veterans are more likely to have a 
disability.6 In large part, veterans have higher disability 
rates because they are older than the population in 
general (about one-half of veterans are aged 65 and 
over). Higher disability rates also stem from service-
related injuries, as well as the physical and psycho-
logical demands of military service. As the veteran 
population ages and faces further age-related health 
issues, examining the prevalence of disability is crucial 
to delivering the benefits and services that veterans 
need.

This report investigates disability among veterans of 
the U.S. armed forces and how they compare to the 
broader nonveteran population.7 It focuses on dis-
ability rates among post-9/11 veterans, i.e., those who 
have served since September 2001. Post-9/11 veter-
ans are the youngest cohort of veterans and more 
recently have been at the forefront of veteran public 
health research. This report uses annual data from the 
American Community Survey (ACS), 2008 to 2019 and 
2021 to 2022. The U.S. Census Bureau did not release 
its standard 2020 ACS 1-year estimates because of 
the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, so data from

2020 were not included in this 
analysis.8 Following an earlier 
report, it looks at the prevalence 
of service-connected disabilities 
(SCD) among veterans as well as 
ACS disabilities among both the 
veteran and nonveteran popu-
lation.9 Lastly, the report uses 
statistical regression analysis to 
examine whether veterans have 
become increasingly likely to 
report an SCD or ACS disability 
over time, while accounting for 
differences in the demographic 
and socio economic composition 
of the veteran population.10 

Highlights 

•  Service-connected disabilities 
were more common in 2022 
than in 2008. About 30 per-
cent of veterans had a service-
connected disability in 2022, up 
from 15 percent in 2008 (Figure 
2a).

•  The share of veterans with 

neither a service-connected 
disability nor an ACS disability 
was around one-half in 2022 (52 
percent), down from two-thirds 
in 2008 (65 percent) (Figure 3).

•  After accounting for the demo-
graphic and socioeconomic 
characteristics of veterans,  
post-9/11 veterans were more 
likely to have a service- 
connected disability in 2022. 
They had a 31 percent chance 
of having a service-connected 
disability in 2022, up from an 18 
percent chance in 2008 (Figure 
5a).

•  In 2022, post-9/11 veterans were 
more likely to have a cognitive 
disability (8.9 percent chance) 
than other veterans (4.8 percent 
chance) or nonveterans (3.8 
percent chance), after account-
ing for the demographic and 
socioeconomic characteristics 
of these groups (Figure 6a).

•  Post-9/11 veterans were more 
likely to report a high service-
connected disability rating than 
in the past. In 2022,  
post-9/11 veterans with a 
service- connected disability had 
a 50 percent chance of report-
ing a high service-connected 
disability rating (i.e., a rating of 
70 percent or greater), up from 
27 percent in 2008 (Figure 7).

MEASURING DISABILITY

Disability is a complex experience 
between individuals and their envi-
ronment and can be measured in 
many ways. The medical model of 

disability views it in terms of medi-
cal conditions that need treatment 
or therapy. Alternatively, the social 
model views disability more as a 
relationship between individual 
abilities and environmental and 
societal conditions.11 This report 
uses the ACS functional disability 
measure. A person reporting “yes” 
to one or more of the disability 
questions (refer to Figure 1) is clas-
sified as having a disability.

In addition, we examine SCDs 
among the veteran population. A 
service-connected disability is an 
injury, illness, or disease that was 
incurred during or aggravated by 
service in the military. ACS mea-
sures service-connected disability 
through individuals’ responses to 
the SCD questions (Figure 1). A

Sample, Definitions, and Concepts

Sample: This report includes civilian veterans and nonveterans 
aged 18 and over who are living in the United States. Veterans are 
individuals who have served on active duty in the past but are not 
currently serving. Nonveterans have never served on active duty 
in the U.S. armed forces. The report excludes active duty service 
members.

ACS disability: Disability estimates in this report come from the 
American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS classifies individuals 
as having a disability if they reported difficulty with specific func-
tional activities. The ACS considers someone to have a disability if 
the individual self-reports having a vision, hearing, cognitive, ambu-
latory, self-care, or independent living difficulty. The ACS attempts 
to measure six aspects of disability, which can be used together to 
create an overall disability measure, or independently to examine 
populations with specific disability types. 

Hearing: Deafness or serious difficulty hearing. 

Vision: Blindness or serious difficulty seeing even when wearing 
glasses.

Cognitive: Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making deci-
sions because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition. 

Ambulatory: Serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs. 

Self-care: Difficulty dressing or bathing.

Independent living: Difficulty doing errands alone, such as visit-
ing a doctor’s office or shopping, because of a physical, mental, or 
emotional condition.

Service-connected disability (SCD): A disability, disease, or injury 
incurred or aggravated during military service. The U.S. Department 
of Veterans Affairs (VA) may assign veterans a disability rating 
based on the severity of a service-connected medical condition. 
The rating is graduated from 0 percent to 100 percent (in incre-
ments of 10 percent). The VA calculates the total service-connected 
disability rating by combining evaluations of each disability rather 
than adding the individual ratings together. This report counts vet-
erans as having an SCD if they answer “yes” to the ACS question-
naire item about having a service-connected disability rating. 

Importantly, service-connected disabilities are reported indepen-
dently of ACS disabilities, and a veteran may report one or both (or 
neither). Information about service-connected disabilities on the 
ACS come from self-reported survey responses, which differ from 
estimates published by the VA that are based on administrative 
records.

High service-connected disability rating: A service-connected dis-
ability rating of 70 percent or higher. This rating does not necessar-
ily represent having a single serious disability, since the VA evalu-
ates each service-connected disability rather than adding individual 
ratings.

person who reports having an SCD 
is classified as having a service-
connected disability. Only veterans 
may have a service-connected dis-
ability, while any respondent may 
report an ACS disability. 

In some instances, the disabilities 
may overlap. A veteran may have 
hearing loss because of an injury 
while serving, so he or she reports 
a hearing difficulty from among 
the listed disabilities on the ACS. 
Other times the disabilities may 
be independent of military service 
(e.g., an older veteran who has dif-
ficulty walking because of his age). 
One of the purposes of this report 
is to investigate the distribution of 
service-connected and ACS dis-
abilities among veterans to better 
understand how these different 
definitions of disability relate to 
one another.

Another dimension of disabil-
ity that the report examines is 
service -connected disability rat-
ings. The VA assigns these ratings 
to veterans based on the severity 
of their injuries, which veterans 
may then self-report on the ACS.12 
The rating is used to determine 
eligibility for compensation as well 
as other benefits and programs. 
Service-connected disability rat-
ings are provided in the form of a 
graduated percentage, between 
zero and 100 percent, which 
represents how much a disability 
affects a veteran’s overall health 
and ability to function. This report 
uses the service-connected dis-
ability ratings that are reported 
in the ACS. In addition, it classi-
fies veterans with a rating of 70 
percent or higher as having a high 
SCD rating.

DISABILITY PREVALENCE 
AMONG VETERANS

The Percentage of Veterans With 
a Service-Connected Disability 
Has Nearly Doubled Since 2008.

Over the past decade, the percent-
age of veterans with a service-
connected disability has nearly 
doubled, from 15.1 percent in 2008 
to 29.5 percent in 2022—corre-
sponding to 4.8 million veterans 
in 2022. ACS disability rates have 
remained more stable, rising from 
26.0 percent to 31.3 percent across 
the same period (Figure 2a). 

Rates of ACS disability tend to be 
higher among older age groups, 
although this report found that 

rates of SCD increased across 
multiple age groups.13 Among 
veterans under the age of 65, the 
rate of service-connected disabil-
ity increased from 16.9 percent 
in 2008 to 34.5 percent in 2022 
(Figure 2b). Among veterans aged 
65 and over, the rate of service-
connected disability increased 
from 12.4 percent in 2008 to 24.4 
percent in 2022 (Figure 2b). 

ACS disability rates increased 
slightly between 2008 and 2022, 
though those aged 65 and over

consistently had higher rates than 
their 65 and under peers through-
out this period. Among veterans 
under the age of 65, ACS disability 
rates increased from 16.7 percent 
in 2008 to 20.3 percent in 2022 
(Figure 2c). Among veterans aged 
65 and over, the rate increased 
from 39.9 percent in 2008 to 42.7 
percent in 2022 (Figure 2c).

Among veterans under the age of 
45, service-connected disabilities 
appear to be rising at a faster rate 
than ACS disabilities. For younger 
veterans, rates of SCD more than 
doubled (from 16.1 percent to 
39.4 percent) between 2008 and 
2022 (Figure 2d). The percentage 
of veterans under the age of 45

who reported an ACS disability 
increased from 9.0 percent to 17.2 
percent across the same period 
(Figure 2d). 

About One-Half of Veterans 
Reported Having No Disability in 
2022.

Veterans with service-connected 
disabilities may not necessarily 
have ACS disabilities such as 
hearing, ambulatory, or self-care 
difficulties (refer to “Measuring 
Disability”). Overall, most veterans 
did not report either type of 
disability. In 2008, 65.1 percent 
of veterans did not report either 
kind of disability (i.e., a service-
connected or ACS-defined 
disability). Over time, however, 
this percentage has declined. By 
2022, just over one-half of veterans 
(51.8 percent) reported having no 
disability at all (Figure 3). 

Interestingly, service-connected 
disabilities appear to be causing 
the decline in the percentage of 
veterans with no disability. The 
prevalence of ACS-only disabilities 
decreased slightly between 2008 
and 2022, while the prevalence of 
SCDs increased markedly (Figure 
3). In 2008, 8.8 percent of veterans 
had only a SCD. By 2022, this fig-
ure had increased to about 17 per-
cent, while the share of veterans 
with both ACS and SCD doubled 
(from 6.2 percent to 12.6 percent 
across the same period). 

Veterans Have Been Reporting 
Higher Service-Connected 
Disability Ratings Over Time.

About one-half of veterans had 
some kind of disability in 2022, 
whether an ACS or service-
connected disability (Figure 3). 
Trends in Figure 3 suggest that 
the increase in disability rates 
overall among veterans is driven 
by the increase in SCD rates 
specifically. Another way to look

at this increase is to examine 
whether more veterans are report-
ing high SCD ratings than in the 
past. We classified veterans with 
a self-reported rating of 70 per-
cent or above as having a high 
SCD rating (for more informa-
tion on veteran disability ratings, 
refer to “Measuring Disability” 
and “Sample, Definitions, and 
Concepts”). For comparison, we 
also examined whether veterans 
reported multiple ACS disabilities. 

The percentage of veterans with a 
high service-connected disability 
rating increased nearly fivefold 
(from 2.6 percent to 12.8 percent) 
between 2008 and 2022 (Figure 
4). Although more veterans 
reported multiple ACS disabilities 

than a high service-connected 
disability rating, the change over 
time for multiple ACS disabilities 
was far less pronounced. Between 
2008 and 2022, the percentage 
of veterans with two or more ACS 
disabilities increased from 12.5 to 
15.3 percent.

The prevalence of high service-
connected disability ratings 
depends on when a veteran 
served. Previous research has indi-
cated that high disability ratings 
are most common among post-
9/11 veterans. In 2018,  
post-9/11 veterans reported the 
largest percentage with a high 
SCD rating (nearly 16 percent), 
followed by Gulf War veterans (13.1 
percent), and Vietnam veterans 

(9.8 percent).14 The prevalence of 
high SCD ratings among Korean 
War and World War II veterans 
was much lower, at 3.4 percent 
and 3.7 percent, respectively (the 
two estimates are not significantly 
different from one another). 

There are several reasons why we 
observe higher SCD ratings among 
more recent service periods, 
including selection bias and policy 
changes. First, only the healthi-
est older veterans are still alive, 
as those with severe disabilities 
would have higher mortality rates,

Tinnitus.
1. 1.  Tinnitus.

Limitation of flexion, knee.
2. 2.  Limitation of flexion, knee.

Hearing loss.
3. 3.  Hearing loss.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Lumbosacral or cervical strain.
5. 5.  Lumbosacral or cervical strain.

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve.
6. 6.  Paralysis of the sciatic nerve.

Scars, general.
7. 7.  Scars, general.

Limitation of motion of the ankle.
8. 8.  Limitation of motion of the ankle.

Limitation of motion of the arm.
9. 9.  Limitation of motion of the arm.

Migraine.

and the healthiest post-9/11 service 
members may still be serving (and 
thus not yet counted among the 
population of veterans).15 Both 
instances would represent selec-
tivity in the veteran population. 
Second, high ratings could reflect 
a greater likelihood of injury or 
illness while serving for post-9/11 
veterans. And third, high ratings 
may reflect changes in the VA’s 
schedule of service-connected dis-
abilities and how their ratings are 
assessed (e.g., changes in eligibil-
ity rules for post-traumatic stress

TYPES OF DISABILITY 
AMONG VETERANS AND 
NONVETERANS

veterans with an ACS disability far

exceeds that of veterans with an 
ACS disability (37.7 million versus 
5.1 million, respectively), disability 
rates are about twice as prevalent 
among the veteran population 
(Table 1). The most common type 
of ACS disability among veterans 
was ambulatory difficulty, followed 
by hearing difficulty. About 16 
percent of veterans reported either 
one. Among nonveterans, the most 
common ACS disability was also 
ambulatory, but the second most 
common was independent living. 
About 8 percent of nonveterans 
reported an ambulatory difficulty 
and 6 percent reported an inde-
pendent living difficulty. 

The types of ACS disability among 
veterans varied widely by their 
period of military service, which is 

a proxy for age.17 For example, over 
two-thirds (69 percent) of veter-
ans who served during the Korean 
War reported an ACS disability. In 
contrast, less than one-quarter of  
Gulf War and post-9/11 veterans 
(21 and 19 percent, respectively) 
reported an ACS disability (Table 2).

Looking at disability type, the pro-
portion of post-9/11 veterans with 
a cognitive disability was higher 
than either Gulf War or Vietnam 
veterans (Table 2). This suggests 
that post-9/11 veterans may be 
more likely to have cognitive dis-
abilities than some groups of vet-
erans. However, cognitive disability 
is closely tied with a veteran’s age 

17 Veterans may serve in multiple periods. 
This report categorizes veterans in their most 
recent period of service.

(as the trends in Table 2 suggest). 
Age differences in veteran cohorts 
must be accounted for to better 
understand the likelihood of hav-
ing a cognitive disability, an analy-
sis that we will return to in the last 
section of the report.

Veterans With a Service-
Connected Disability (SCD) Are 
Twice as Likely to Have Cognitive 
Difficulty Than Veterans Without 
an SCD. 

Although the ACS does not collect 
information on the specific disabil-
ity diagnoses, this report esti-
mated general disability categories 
among veterans with SCDs by 
examining which ACS difficulties 
they reported. In 2022, 42.7 per-
cent of veterans with an SCD also 
reported having at least one ACS 
disability (Table 3). Among these 
veterans, the most prevalent ACS 
disability was hearing, followed by 
ambulatory. 

Across each of the six types of 
ACS disabilities, veterans with an 
SCD were more likely to report a 
difficulty than veterans without 
an SCD. In other words, all types 
of disability measured by the ACS 
were overrepresented among 
veterans with an SCD (Table 3). 
Interestingly, veterans with an SCD 

were twice as likely to report cog-
nitive difficulty as their peers who 
did not have an SCD.

REGRESSION ANALYSIS: 
PREDICTING THE LIKELIHOOD 
OF HAVING A SERVICE-
CONNECTED DISABILITY 
OVER TIME

Veterans have higher ACS dis-
ability rates than nonveterans, and 
post-9/11 veterans have higher 
rates of SCDs than other veteran 
groups. Several different factors 
likely underlie these trends. The 
most obvious is age. The veteran 
population is substantially older 
than the American population in 
general (median age of 65 versus 
39).18 As a result, ACS disability 
rates such as hearing or vision 
difficulties may be higher among 
veterans because they are much 
older, on average, than the general 
population. Even among veterans, 
certain service cohorts may have 
selective characteristics, such as 
sex, education, or distinctive tours 

18 For the median age of veterans, refer 
to J. Vespa, “Those Who Served: America’s 
Veterans From World War II to the War 
on Terror,” American Community Survey 
Reports, ACS-43, U.S. Census Bureau, 
Washington, DC, 2020. For the median 
age of the U.S. population, refer to “Table 
S0101: Age and Sex,” U.S. Census Bureau, 
Washington, DC, <https://data.census.gov/
table/ACSST1Y2022.S0101>.

of duty and service experiences, 
that are linked to either ACS or 
service-connected disabilities. 
Another reason that veterans 
may have higher disability rates is 
because they were injured while 
serving or that the physical and 
mental stresses of training or com-
bat took a toll on their health. 

To try to account for these numer-
ous factors, we used a type of 
statistical analysis, logistic regres-
sion, to test whether ACS and 
service-connected disability rates 
have significantly increased over 
time while taking into account the 
effect of other characteristics, such 
as age. This ability is the chief ben-
efit of regression analysis—that it 
helps separate the effects of time 
and period of service from other 
factors that also affect disability. In 
a sense, regression analysis lets us 
compare veterans and nonveter-
ans of the same age, sex, race, and 
income (among other character-
istics) so that veteran status is the 
only measured difference between 
them, thereby isolating the effect 
that being a veteran has on disabil-
ity prevalence. 

To aid in interpreting the regres-
sion analyses, this report presents 
a series of predicted probabilities 
in Figures 5 through 7. Predicted

probabilities are the likelihood or 
chance that a veteran has a type 
of disability (the full regression 
results are presented in Appendix 
B). They were calculated holding a 
veteran’s demographic and socio-
economic characteristics at their 
mean level (i.e., the probabilities 
reflect the chances of having an 
ACS or service-connected disabil-
ity for the average veteran).

Regression Analysis Shows That 
Service-Connected Disability 
Rates Have Increased Significantly 
Among Post-9/11 Veterans Since 
2008.

trend is that the rate of increase 
was about one-and-one-half times 
greater for post-9/11 veterans 
than for veterans of other service 
periods.

On average, post-9/11 veterans had 
a 31.3 percent chance of having 
a service-connected disability in 
2022, up from 17.7 percent in 2008. 
In comparison, the probability for 
other veterans increased more 
slowly, from 11.1 to 21.0 percent, 
across the same period (Figure 
5a). Another way of looking at this 

In contrast to the increasing 
likelihood of having a service- 
connected disability, the prob-
ability of having a general ACS 
disability did not change for 
post-9/11 veterans between 2008 
and 2022 (Figure 5b). Their overall 
probability is significantly higher 
than that of other veterans, which

is surprising. Other veterans are 
much older than post-9/11 veter-
ans, and a person’s age is a key 
factor in developing disabilities 
such as difficulty seeing, hearing, 
or walking. Even when compared 
with nonveterans, post-9/11 veter-
ans were twice as likely to have an 
ACS disability in 2022 (10.5 per-
cent chance for nonveterans com-
pared with 22.0 percent chance for 
post-9/11 veterans). 

Looking at the intersection of 
SCDs and ACS disabilities, the 
probability of veterans reporting 
both types increased significantly 
since 2008. A post-9/11 veteran 
had about a 9 percent chance of 
reporting both kinds of disability, 
compared with about a 7 percent 
chance for other veterans in 2022 
(Figure 5c). 

Taken together, the results in these 
three figures (Figures 5a through 
5c) show that post-9/11 veterans 
were more likely to report an SCD 
than other veterans and were more 
likely to report an ACS disabil-
ity than either other veterans or 
no nveterans. Furthermore, post-
9/11 veterans’ chances of reporting 
a service-connected disability have 
increased significantly over time.

Regression Analysis Shows 
That Post-9/11 Veterans Were 
More Likely to Have a Cognitive 
Disability Than the Broader 
Population.

Cognitive impairments are one 
type of disability that respondents 
can report on the ACS. Cognitive 
disability includes difficulty con-
centrating, remembering, or mak-
ing decisions because of a physi-
cal, mental, or emotional condition. 
Do post-9/11 veterans have distinc-
tive trends in reporting cognitive 
disabilities? 

They do. Post-9/11 veterans were 
more likely to have a cognitive 

disability than other veterans, even 
after accounting for differences 
in their demographic and socio-
economic characteristics: an 8.9 
percent chance compared with a 
4.8 percent chance, respectively 
(Figure 6a).

Post-9/11 veterans may be more 
likely to report a cognitive disabil-
ity because this type of condition 
has become more common among 
younger groups of people over-
all, regardless of military service. 
Among the nonveteran population, 
the chances of having a cognitive 
disability have risen since 2008, 
but those chances are significantly 
lower than those for post-9/11 
veterans—even after accounting 
for age differences between these 
groups. A nonveteran had a 3.8 
percent chance of having a cogni-
tive disability in 2022, compared 
with an 8.9 percent chance for 
post-9/11 veterans (Figure 6a). 

Looking at the intersection of 
service-connected and cogni-
tive disabilities, regression results 
show that the probability of having 
a cognitive disability is highest 
among veterans with an SCD. For 
veterans who do not have an SCD, 
the chances of having a cognitive 
disability are significantly smaller 
(Figure 6b). More importantly, the 
regression results show that these 
probabilities in 2022 were not sig-
nificantly different than they were 
in 2008.

The Census Bureau does not col-
lect information on specific types 
of service-connected disability. It 
is possible that cognitive impair-
ment is a proxy for reporting post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
and other major symptoms of 
depression. Other researchers have 
reported that rates of PTSD have 
been rising over time, although it is 
unclear whether post-9/11 veterans 

are more likely to report it than 
other veterans.19, 20 

Regression Results Show That 
Having High Service-Connected 
Disability Ratings Was More Likely 
in 2022 Than 2008. 

As discussed earlier in the report, 
more veterans are reporting high 
SCD ratings than in the past. This 
kind of rating represents one or 
more injuries or conditions that 
severely impair a veteran’s daily 
life and activities. Since 2008, the 
proportion of veterans with a high 
service-connected disability rating 
has increased from 2.6 percent to 
12.8 percent in 2022 (Figure 4). 

Regression results support this 
conclusion. Among post-9/11 
veterans with a service-connected 
disability, the probability of having 
a high disability rating increased 
from 27.4 to 50.4 percent between 
2008 and 2022 (Figure 7). In other 
words, if post-9/11 veterans have 
a service-connected disability, 
there is a 1-in-2 chance that it will 
be rated at 70 percent or higher. 
These chances were higher than 
those for other veterans, although 
the probability for other veterans 
increased significantly as well 
(from 18.7 to 38.2 percent across 
the same period).

than other veterans, and why these 
chances have increased over time. 
As prior research has noted,  
post-9/11 veterans may be more 
likely to experience an injury 
during their service because of 
distinctive tours of duty or ser-
vice conditions that other veteran 
cohorts did not experience.21 What 
is more, medical advances have 
made it more likely for veterans 
to survive injuries that would have

Afghanistan, the number of veterans with 
service-connected disabilities has increased 
since 2001, after decades of remaining 
relatively stable. Refer to M. Duggan, “The

Compensation Program,” Stanford University

been fatal in prior decades.22 Both 
reasons could explain why  
post-9/11 veterans were more likely 
to have a service connected or 
ACS disability than other veterans. 

These are not the only reasons, 
however. One alternative may be

selection bias. Only the healthiest 
and youngest veterans of older 
service periods (such as World 
War II, the Korean War, and the 
Vietnam War) are still alive today. 
The oldest individuals, and those 
in the worst health, have already 
passed away, which has left a 
selective group of older veterans 
who look healthier compared with 
post-9/11 veterans. Similarly, the 
youngest post-9/11 service mem-
bers may still be serving on active 
duty and therefore are not yet 
counted among the veteran popu-
lation (ACS classifies individuals as 
veterans if they served in the past 
but are not currently serving on 
active duty).

More importantly, changes in 
service-connected disabilities and 
ratings are directly tied to how the 
VA classifies and assigns ratings. 
Such policy changes would sub-
stantially alter service-connected 
disability rates and ratings among 
veterans. For example, classifi-
cations for PTSD have changed 
significantly over time.23 The impor-
tance of these kinds of adjustments 
and schedule changes cannot be 
overstated because they directly 
affect the number of veterans with 
a service-connected disability and 
which disability rating has been 
assigned to those injuries and ill-
nesses. The regression analyses 
presented in this report do not 
control for these kinds of policy 
and schedule changes.

SUMMARY

This report examined two types 
of disability rates among veter-
ans, ACS-defined disabilities and 
service-connected disabilities, and 
explored whether their probability 
of having either kind of disability 
has increased over time. Compared 
with 2008, veterans in 2022 were 
more likely to have a service-
connected disability and to have 
a high SCD rating (i.e., an SCD 
rating of 70 percent or higher). In 
contrast, although the likelihood 
of having an ACS disability has not 
increased since 2008, veterans 
remained significantly more likely

veterans were more likely to have a 
disability than both other veterans 
and nonveterans on several dif-
ferent levels: (1) to have a service-
connected disability; (2) to have a 
high service-connected disability 
rating; (3) to have an ACS-defined 
disability; and (4) to have a cogni-
tive disability. For each of these 
dimensions of disability, post-9/11 
veterans were more likely to have 
that kind of disability than other 
groups of veterans. Additionally, 
post-9/11 veterans’ chances of hav-
ing these dimensions of disability 
have all increased since 2008 
(except for ACS disabilities, which 
did not significantly change over 
time).

These findings come with impor-
tant caveats. The regression analy-
ses were limited by what could be 
measured with ACS data. Other 
characteristics may underlie the 
link between post-9/11 veterans 

and disability, such as length of 
military service and repeated tours 
of duty to war zones. Regression 
analysis cannot show that military 
service causes more injuries and 
illnesses today. Medical technol-
ogy allows veterans to survive 
injuries that might have been fatal 
in the past. And more importantly, 
changes in service-connected 
disabilities are directly tied to 
adjustments in the VA’s ratings and 
schedules. 

We conclude that post-9/11 vet-
erans were more likely to have a 
service-connected disability than 
other groups of veterans and that 
the likelihood has significantly 
increased since 2008. Post-9/11 
veterans were more likely to have 
a high SCD rating than they were 
in 2008. This report highlights the 
need to better understand how 
the physical and psychological 
demands of military service affect 

the long-term health and well-
being of veterans, as well as the 
importance of examining multiple 
dimensions of disability. 

DATA, SOURCE, AND 
ACCURACY 

This report uses data from the 
American Community Survey, 
which is a nationwide survey 
designed to provide timely and 
reliable data every year on the 
demographic, social, economic, 
and housing characteristics of the 
nation, states, counties, and other 
localities. The survey has an annual 
sample size of about 3.5 million 
addresses across the United States 
and Puerto Rico and includes both 
housing units and group quarters. 
The ACS is conducted in every 
county throughout the nation. The 
ACS 1-year data are released for 
geographic areas with populations 
of 65,000 or greater. The ACS 
5-year data are released for all 
geographic areas. For information 
on the ACS sample design and 
other topics, visit <www.census.
gov/programs-surveys/acs/>. 

Data in this report come from the 
2008 through 2022 American 
Community Survey (excluding 
the 2020 ACS) and are subject to 
sampling and nonsampling error. 
Comparisons of estimates in the 
report have taken sampling error 
into account and are significant 
at the 90 percent confidence 
level or higher, unless otherwise 
noted. Because of rounding, some 
details may not sum to totals. 
For information on sampling and 
estimation methods, confidentiality 
protection, and sampling and 
non sampling errors, refer to the

APPENDIX A. METHODS AND DATA LIMITATIONS 

This report used the American 
Community Survey (ACS) 1-year 
estimates from 2008 through 
2019 and 2021 to 2022. The 
target population included 
U.S. veteran and nonveteran 
civilians, aged 18 and over, 
living in the United States. The 
civilian population refers to 
people living in households and 
group quarters (except military 
barracks) who are not on active 
duty in the U.S. armed forces. 
Therefore, the report excluded 
active-duty service members. 
For technical information on the 
ACS, refer to <www.census.gov/
programs-surveys/acs/technical-
documentation.html>.

To examine whether veterans 
have become more likely to report 
an ACS disability or service- 
connected disability over time, 
we used logistic regression analy-
sis, which is a statistical tool that 
helps calculate the effect that one 
variable has on another. Because 
numerous factors affect the likeli-
hood of having a disability, regres-
sion allows us to separate these 
competing influences. For exam-
ple, veterans of different service 
periods vary in their demographic 
and social characteristics—whether 
age, sex, or income. Since these 
characteristics are also associ-
ated with a veteran’s likelihood of 
reporting a disability, we want to 
use regression analysis to calculate 
the effects of time or post-9/11 
military service net of a veteran’s 
age, sex, or income.

The regression results presented 
in Appendix B show odds ratios, 
which are the odds of having a dis-
ability relative to a particular com-
parison group (e.g., men versus 
women). Odds ratios of “1” indicate 
that the odds are the same for the 

comparison groups. Odds ratios 
“greater than 1” indicate higher 
odds of reporting a disability, while 
those “less than 1” indicate smaller 
odds. Because of the statistical 
power of the ACS sample, we only 
report significance for estimates 
that are at least “p < .001.” A sig-
nificance level of “p < .001” means 
a less than 1 in 1,000 chance that 
an estimate is a random result. 

The regression models included 
the following variables as controls:

•  Year: Linear or dichotomous 

variable measuring the survey 
year.

•  Veteran status: Categorical vari-
able indicating whether respon-
dents were (0) not a veteran,  
(1) a veteran who served prior 
to September 2001, or (2) a vet-
eran who served in 2001 or later. 
Veterans are classified by their 
most recent period of service.

•  VA health care: Dichotomous 

variable indicating whether the 
veteran was enrolled for health 
care through the Department of 
Veterans Affairs.

•  Sex: Dichotomous variable for 
whether the respondent was  
(0) female or (1) male.

•  Age: Linear variable measuring 
the respondent’s age in years.

•  Race and Hispanic origin: 

Categorical variable indicating 
whether respondents were  
(0) non-Hispanic White,  
(1) non-Hispanic Black,  
(2) Hispanic, or (3) non-Hispanic 
Some Other Race.

•  Group quarters: Dichotomous 
variable measuring whether 
respondents lived in (1) group 
quarters, excluding military bar-
racks, or (0) a household.

•  Marital status: Dichotomous 
variable measuring whether 
respondents were (1) married 
or (0) not married, including 
divorced, separated, widowed, 
and never married.

•  Educational attainment: 

Categorical variable measured 
by the respondent’s highest 
level of education: (0) high 
school diploma or less, (1) some 
college but no degree, (2) bach-
elor’s degree or higher.

•  Income-to-poverty ratio: A cat-

egorical measure of respondents’ 
income relative to the poverty 
threshold, coded: (0) less than 
150 percent, (1) 150 percent to 
299 percent, (2) 300 percent to 
499 percent, and (3) 500 per-
cent or higher.

•  Public assistance: A dichoto-
mous measure of whether a 
respondent received certain 
government assistance pro-
grams, coded as: (1) received 
food stamps, public assistance 
income, or Supplemental 
Security Income, and (0) did not 
receive any of these programs.

To help interpret the regression 
analyses, we reported predicted 
probabilities in Figures 5 through 
7, which are the chances, in terms 
of a percentage, that a veteran 
has an ACS or service-connected 
disability (with 0 percent meaning 
no chance and 100 percent mean-
ing complete certainty). Predicted 
probabilities were calculated 
using the results of the logistic 
regressions in Appendix B. They 
were calculated while holding a 
veteran’s demographic and socio-
economic characteristics at their 
mean level. In other words, the 
predicted probabilities represent 
the chance that the average vet-
eran would report a disability.

There are several limitations to 
the data presented in this report. 
ACS estimates are based on self-
reported survey responses and 
are susceptible to response and 
nonresponse bias. Furthermore, 
because the data are self-reported, 
estimates of service-connected 
disability will not match those 
published by the VA, which are 
based on administrative records. 
The ACS measurement of disabil-
ity is not comprehensive. There 
may be other types of disability 
or a range of severity that are not 
represented by the results in this 
report. 

Another limitation is the sampling 
structure of the ACS. Ideally, we 
would like to measure the dis-
abilities of the same veterans every 
year to observe how their health 
changes over time. Even though 
the ACS is collected annually, it 
does not sample the same house-
holds every year. Thus, the data 
represent repeated cross-sections 
of the veteran population, which 
we use as a proxy for measuring 
veteran health over time. 

Last, regression analysis cannot 
definitively identify cause and 
effect. As discussed in the final 
section of the report, there are 

other possible explanations why 
disability rates, especially service-
connected ones, may be rising for 
post-9/11 veterans. These include 
unmeasured characteristics such 
as length of service and tours of 
duty, as well as various kinds of 
reporting and sampling bias. They 
also include changes in how the 
VA classifies and scores SCDs, 
which, as a result, directly affect 
the prevalence of SCDs. The analy-
sis does not account for this kind 
of change.
