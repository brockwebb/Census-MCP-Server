Highlights

In 2023, most people, 92.0 percent or 305.2 million, had health insurance, either for some or all of the year.

In 2023, private health insurance coverage continued to be more prevalent than public coverage, at 65.4 percent and 36.3
percent, respectively.

Of the subtypes of health insurance coverage, employment-based insurance was the most common, covering 53.7 percent of
the population for some or all of the calendar year, followed by Medicaid (18.9 percent), Medicare (18.9 percent), direct-
purchase coverage (10.2 percent), TRICARE (2.6 percent), and VA and CHAMPVA coverage (1.0 percent).

While the private coverage rate was statistically unchanged between 2022 and 2023, the employment-based coverage rate
declined by 0.7 percentage points to 53.7 percent in 2023. At the same time, the rate of direct-purchase coverage increased by
0.3 percentage points to 10.2 percent in 2023.

The 2023 public coverage rate was not statistically different from the rate in 2022. Whereas, Medicare coverage increased by
0.2 percentage points to cover 18.9 percent of people.

The uninsured rate for children under the age of 19 increased by 0.5 percentage points to 5.8 percent between 2022 and 2023.
