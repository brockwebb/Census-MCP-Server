Note for Language Spoken at Home from the 2016 American 
Community Survey  

The American Community Survey (ACS) collects data on whether or not people five years old or older 
speak a language other than English at home. If a respondent indicates speaking a language other than 
English, the ACS asks what language the person speaks and how well the person speaks English.  Figure 1 
shows how the question appears on the ACS questionnaire.

2016 ACS Language coding update 

Beginning with 2016 1-year and 2012-2016 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data, coding of 
specific languages reflects languages in accordance with the International Organization for 
Standardization’s ISO-639-3 standard.1 To the extent possible,  languages in the code list are those 
considered individual spoken  languages. A few languages reflect common write-ins that cannot be 
classified as individual languages (i.e., country names or language families).  

Changes to tables B16001, C16001, and B16002 

The rows presented in American Community Survey tables B16001, C16001, and B16002 have been 
updated to reflect changes in the number of people speaking different languages. Languages and 
language categories that have grown have been added to these tables, while some that have decreased 
are no longer displayed individually  but instead included in an aggregated form. Some categories are the 
same except for an updated label. Guidance for comparing estimates from the 2015 and 2016 language 
tables is included below.

In tabulations, languages have sometimes been combined to create a category that reflects a major 
language family or geographical area instead of an individual  spoken language. Our chief reason for 
aggregating languages together is out of concern for the privacy of respondents, especially in 
standardized data products that are designed to be available for small towns and rural areas where 
there may be only a few people speaking a given language. We also want to avoid presenting data with a 
small sample size in order to ensure data quality. The goal of the 2016 table redesign was to publish 
language data that are as useful as possible, working within these constraints.  

Example languages have been added to the labels of residual “other” categories. For example, “Other 
Slavic languages” is now “Ukrainian and other Slavic languages.” These example languages are among 
the largest within their respective “other” categories, but not large enough to provide data for in our 
standardized tables. Data for these example languages, and other language categories with at least 
10,000 speakers nationwide, are available in the 2016 1-year and 2012-2016 5-year Public Use 
Microdata Sample (PUMS) data files.22 

B16001 and C16001 redesign 

In American FactFinder, Table B16001 provides the most detail for individual languages, tabulated by 
English-speaking ability. Table C16001 is a collapsed specific-language table with fewer languages.  The 
categories in B16001 and C16001 were revised beginning with 2016 1-year and 2012-2016 5-year data, 
to better reflect the most commonly spoken  languages in the United States.  

With the exception of Navajo and Other Native North American languages, each language and language 
category shown in B16001 had 200,000 speakers or more nationwide in 2016. Each language and 
“other” category in C16001 had one million  speakers or more nationwide in 2016.

Compare with caution between 2015 and 2016: 

  French (incl. Cajun):  In 2015, the code for Patois was grouped with French in table B16001. 
Beginning in 2016, “Patois” is usually coded as Jamaican Creole English unless  a more 
appropriate code is indicated. Data for Jamaican Creole English are available in the PUMS files. 
  French Creole:  In 2015, all French-based creole languages were coded as “French Creole.” In the 
United States, the majority of French Creole speakers speak Haitian. In 2016, Haitian and some 
French-based creoles of the Caribbean that are generally mutually intelligible are categorized as 
Haitian. These include Guadeloupe Creole French and Saint Lucian Creole French. French-based 
creole languages that are not intelligible with Haitian are grouped in “Other and unspecified 
languages.” 

Comparable between 2015 and 2016, but requires the use of PUMS data: 

  Yiddish has been combined with Other West Germanic languages in the B16001 table. 2016 data 

for Yiddish  are available in the PUMS files. 

  Bengali, Punjabi, Telugu, and Tamil are all new to the B16001 table. Previous years’ data for 

these languages are available in the PUMS files. 

  Scandinavian languages has been combined with Other Indo-European languages in the 2016 
B16001 table. 2016 data for individual Scandinavian languages are available in the PUMS files. 
  Thai and Laotian were previously on their own rows but are now combined within “Thai, Lao, or 
other Tai-Kadai languages.” 2016 data for Thai and Lao are individually  available in the PUMS. 
  Malayalam, Kannada, or other Dravidian languages is a new category for the 2016 B16001 table. 
All Dravidian languages were included under “Other Asian languages” in the 2015 B16001 table. 
Individual-language data for Malayalam or Kannada are available in the PUMS files. 

Not comparable between 2015 and 2016: 

  Other Indo-European languages 
  Other languages of Asia 
  Amharic, Somali, or other Afro-Asiatic languages 
  Yoruba, Twi, Igbo, or other languages of Western Africa 
  Swahili or other languages of Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa 
  Other and unspecified languages 

C16001 comparability 

Many rows in C16001 have received label changes. However, languages in C16001 are comparable with 
the previous year’s C16001, except: 

  Arabic is new to C16001, and was previously  only available in B16001 and PUMS datasets. 
  The “Other and Unspecified” row no longer contains Arabic. 
 

In 2016, C16001 also displays English proficiency categories. Each language category now 
contains three rows – total speakers, population who speak English “very well,” and population 
who speak English “less than very well.” 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional geographical restrictions to B16001 for 5-year estimates 

Geographical restrictions have been applied to Table B16001 - LANGUAGE SPOKEN AT HOME BY ABILITY 
TO SPEAK ENGLISH FOR THE POPULATION 5 YEARS AND OVER for the 5-year data estimates. These 
restrictions are in place to protect data privacy for the speakers of smaller languages. Geographic areas 
published  for the 5-year B16001 table include: Nation (010), States (040), Metropolitan Statistical Area-
Metropolitan Divisions (314), Combined Statistical Areas (330), Congressional Districts (500), and Public 
Use Microdata Sample Areas (PUMAs) (795). For more information on these geographical delineations, 
see the Metropolitan Statistical Area Reference Files. County and tract-level data are no longer available 
for table B16001. For specific language data for these smaller geographies, please use table C16001. 
Additional languages are also available in the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), at the State and 
Public Use Microdata Sample Area (PUMA) levels of geography. 

Expanded household-level data 

A new household  language table, B16002, is available using 2016 ACS 1-year data. This table shows 
more detailed data for households  defined as limited English-speaking.3 The 2016 B16002 table uses the 
same categories as table C16001, but at a household  level.  

A collapsed household  language table, C16002, is available in 2016 1-year and 2012-2016 5-year data. 
The format of C16002 is the same as B16002 from 2015. The 2016 table C16002 is directly comparable 
with the 2015 household  language table B16002. In addition to this new detailed household  language 
data, more new household language data are available in the 1-year 2016 PUMS, using the new variable 
HHLANP, which contains the same languages as listed for individuals  (LANP). 

3 A "limited English speaking household" is one in which no member 14 years old and over (1) speaks only English 
or (2) speaks a non-English language and speaks English "very well." In other words, all members 14 years old and 
over have at least some difficulty with English. By definition, English-only households cannot belong to this group. 
Previous Census Bureau data products referred to these households as "linguistically isolated" and "Household 
where no one age 14 and over speaks English only or speaks English ‘very well.’"
