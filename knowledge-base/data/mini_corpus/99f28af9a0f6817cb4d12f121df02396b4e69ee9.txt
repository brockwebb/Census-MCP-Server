Notes on Comparability 

2022 Service Annual Survey (SAS) 

The 2021 SAS estimates were revised to reflect historical corrections to current sample data.  
Corrections are made to replace previously reported data with more accurate data received at a  
later date or to replace imputed data with reported data. Additional information is available on the SAS 
Methodology page. 

Restatement to the 2017 NAICS 

The 2022 Service Annual Survey (SAS) estimates were re-released to incorporate the 2017 North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS). Publication tables were reformatted to incorporate the 2017 NAICS 
definitions. This change does not affect the total service sector levels in E-stats. 

Additional information is available on the SAS 2017 NAICS Restatement page. 

2022 Annual Wholesale Trade Survey (AWTS) 

The 2021 AWTS estimates were revised to reflect historical corrections to current sample data.

2022 Annual Retail Trade Survey (ARTS)

Removal of Nonemployers  

Previously in the Annual Retail Trade Survey, firms without paid employees, or nonemployers, were 
included in the estimates through imputation or administrative data provided by other federal agencies. In 
addition to the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) changes, the Annual Retail 
Trade Survey restated data to include employer-only time series to be aligned with the Annual Integrated 
Economic Survey (AIES).  

Additional information is available on the ARTS Summary of Changes (restated) page. 

2022 Economic Census (EC)-Manufacturing and 2021 Annual Survey of 
Manufactures (ASM)  

The 2022 manufacturing estimates are based on the 2022 EC. Every five years, for years ending in 2 
and 7, the U.S. Census Bureau collects detailed statistics about businesses that are essential to 
understanding the American economy. Data produced from the 2022 Economic Census are based 
on the 2022 NAICS.  

The 2021 manufacturing establishments were based on the 2021 ASM. Data produced from the 
2021 ASM are based on the 2017 NAICS. A new sample was selected at 5-year intervals beginning 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the second survey year subsequent to the EC. The last sample was selected in 2019, the second 
year following the 2017 Economic Census-Manufacturing.
