Modification to the 5-Year
Estimation Methodology
Containing Data Collected
in 2020

March 2022

Due to issues with the nonresponse bias present in the American Community Survey (ACS) data

collected in 2020 [/library/working-papers/2021/acs/2021_CensusBureau_01.html] , the 2016–2020 ACS
5-year housing unit weighting was modified to enhance our ability to mitigate that bias. Our revised

methodology incorporated the entropy-balance weighting (EBW) methodology [/library/working-

papers/2021/acs/2021_Rothbaum_01.html] used to produce the 2020 ACS 1-year experimental data

products [/programs-surveys/acs/data/experimental-data.html] into our standard production
methodology. The goal was to leverage the EBW to reduce the bias in the 2020 portion of the 5-year data

while keeping our standard methodology as intact as possible to support producing estimates for all of

our standard 5-year geographic areas.

To accomplish this integration, we devised a modified set of steps in the estimation methodology to
partially process the four years of data from 2016–2019 using our standard methods before combining

those data with the 2020 data that had been processed using the EBW methodology. Once the years

2016–2020 were pooled together, we applied population and housing unit control totals, derived from

estimates produced by the Population Estimates Program, as we normally do.

This modification will be applied to subsequent 5-year estimates that include data collected in 2020.
