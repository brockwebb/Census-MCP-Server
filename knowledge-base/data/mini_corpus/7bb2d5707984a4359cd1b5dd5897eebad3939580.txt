We ask questions about the highest level of education a person

has completed and the ﬁeld of any completed undergraduate

college degrees to create statistics about education.

Local, state, tribal, and federal agencies use education data to

measure changes in education over time, evaluate the

educational attainment of the workforce, and understand the

Educational attainment, undergraduate field of degree data help communities:

Educate Children and Adults

We ask about educational attainment to help schools understand the needs of adult students who do not have a high school

diploma or equivalent and qualify for grants that help fund programs for these students (Workforce Investment Act).

We ask about undergraduate ﬁeld of degree because knowing the major ﬁelds of study of adults with bachelor's degrees enable

efforts to develop the nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics labor force (America COMPETES

Reauthorization Act of 2010).

Ensure Equal Opportunity

We want to know about the educational attainment of workers compared to those seeking employment in combination with age,

sex, race, Hispanic origin, disability status, and other data, to help enforce nondiscrimination in employment by federal agencies

private employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations (Civil Rights Act of 1964). This information is also used in

targeting voting rights enforcement (Voting Rights Act).

History of educational attainment, undergraduate field of degree questions

Educational attainment originated with the 1940 Census. It was transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the decennial

census long form. Undergraduate ﬁeld of degree was added in 2009.
