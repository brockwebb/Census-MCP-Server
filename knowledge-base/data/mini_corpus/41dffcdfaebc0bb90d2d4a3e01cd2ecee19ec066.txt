Understanding and Using
American Community
Survey Data: What State
and Local Government
Users Need to Know

August 2020

A primary mission of state and local

governments is to deliver efficient

and effective services and enact

policies that advance public safety
and economic growth. For more than
a decade, the U.S. Census Bureau’s

American Community Survey (ACS)
has provided data to help
governments meet the needs of their
constituents. The ACS provides a
dynamic picture of the population
and housing attributes of states,
counties, and municipalities, large
and small.

This guide provides a brief overview
of how state and local governments

are using ACS data to develop
general plans, to help implement and
evaluate local initiatives, to attract
and retain businesses, and for other
applications. It also describes some
important considerations when
working with ACS data—especially
estimates for small geographic
areas.
