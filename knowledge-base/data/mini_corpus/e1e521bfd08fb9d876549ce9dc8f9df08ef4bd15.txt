members, or a policy analyst at a
federal agency wants to measure the
effectiveness of programs that fund
critical health care services to

America’s communities, including
information about the characteristics
of American Indians and Alaska

Natives and the areas where they

available to their communities to

inform future decisions.

This handbook provides an overview of the ACS to help tribal data users and others understand the basics of the

survey, how the data can be used, how to judge the accuracy of ACS estimates, and how to access ACS data on the

Census Bureau’s Web site. It also includes some recent case studies that show how ACS data are being used to help

address important policy and program issues facing American Indian and Alaska Native populations. Links to

additional ACS resources, including technical documentation for more advanced users, are included throughout this

handbook.
