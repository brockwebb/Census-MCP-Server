The Emergency and Transitional Shelter 
Population: 2020

INTRODUCTION

This report is the third by the 
U.S. Census Bureau focusing on 
the population in emergency and 
transitional shelters and their 
demographic characteristics.1 
Special reports were written after 
the 2000 and 2010 Censuses were 
conducted.2 The 2020 report is 
formatted similarly to the 2010 
report for easier comparison. 
According to the 2020 Census, 
there were 188,889 people in 
emergency and transitional 
shelters in the United States. This 
amounted to 2.3 percent of the 8.2 
million people counted in group 
quarters (GQs) in the 2020 Census.

Emergency and transitional shelter 
data were collected as part of 
service-based enumeration (SBE) 
during the 2020 Census Group 
Quarters operations. The 2020 
SBE provided an opportunity 
for people without conventional 
housing or people experiencing 
homelessness to be included in 
the census by enumerating them 
at places where they received 
services or at preidentified outdoor 
locations. In addition to emergency 
and transitional shelters, people 
were enumerated at soup kitchens, 
regularly scheduled food vans, and 
targeted nonsheltered outdoor 
locations (e.g., people staying 

1 In this report, “emergency and 

transitional shelters” refers to emergency and 
transitional shelters (with sleeping facilities) 
for people experiencing homelessness.

2020 DEFINITIONS

Group Quarters

A group quarters is a place where people live or stay, in a group 
living arrangement that is owned or managed by an entity or 
organization providing housing and/or services for the residents. 
These services may include custodial or medical care as well as 
other types of assistance, and residency is commonly restricted to 
those receiving these services. This is not a typical household-type 
living arrangement. People living in group quarters are usually not 
related to each other.

Group quarters include such places as college residence halls, 
residential treatment centers, skilled-nursing facilities, group homes, 
military barracks, correctional facilities, and workers’ dormitories.*

Emergency and Transitional Shelters (With Sleeping Facilities) for 
People Experiencing Homelessness

Facilities where people experiencing homelessness stay overnight. 
These include:

•  Shelters that operate on a first-come, first-served basis where 

people must leave in the morning and have no guaranteed bed 
for the next night.

•  Shelters where people know that they have a bed for a specified 

period of time (even if they leave the building every day). 

•  Shelters that provide temporary shelter during extremely cold 
weather (such as churches). This category does not include 
shelters that operate only in the event of a natural disaster.

Examples are emergency and transitional shelters; missions; hotels 
and motels used to shelter people experiencing homelessness; 
shelters for children who are runaways, neglected, or experiencing 
homelessness; and similar places known to have people experienc-
ing homelessness.

outside in certain preidentified 
places like encampments under 
bridges or in parking lots).3

The 2020 SBE was scheduled 
for March 30–April 1, 2020, but 
because of the onset of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in the United 
States, SBE was rescheduled to 
September 22–24, 2020.4 In cases 
where a person enumerated at 
a shelter was also enumerated 
elsewhere, or indicated another 
location where they sometimes live 
or stay, the person was counted at 
the shelter.5

The Census Bureau cautions data 
users that any attempt to use the 
results from SBE as a measure 
of the overall number of people 
experiencing homelessness would 
be inaccurate. The population 
at emergency and transitional 
shelters and other service-
based GQs represents only part 
of the population experiencing 
homelessness. The Census Bureau 
does not produce or publish data 
specifically on the population 
experiencing homelessness, but 
during the decennial census, we 
do enumerate people at certain 
types of facilities that serve the 
population. People experiencing

Group Quarters operations including 
the service-based enumeration can be 
found in the “Group Quarters Operation 
Detailed Operational Plan v2.0” at <https://

Census can be found in the “2020 Census 
Topic Report: Potential Quality Impact 
of the COVID-19 Pandemic” at <https://

5 Where people are counted was 
determined by the official residence 
criteria and residence situations for the 
2020 Census. More information is available 
at <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/
decennial-census/decade/2020/about/
residence-rule.html>.

homelessness may also be 
enumerated in other decennial 
census operations. For instance, 
people in shelters that operate 
only in an event of a natural 
disaster are counted apart from 
the SBE operations but included 
in the noninstitutionalized GQ 
population. People who were 
experiencing homelessness and 
were temporarily staying with 
friends were counted as part of 
other operations, using housing 
unit enumeration procedures. In 
addition, the internet self-response 
option (introduced in the 2020 
Census) allowed people to respond 
with a location description for 
their residence in lieu of a specific 
address. None of these operations 
separately identified people 
experiencing homelessness. While 
the Census Bureau mounted 
extensive operations to obtain 
a comprehensive enumeration, 
we will not produce a separate 
tabulation of the number of people 
experiencing homelessness.

AGE AND SEX COMPOSITION

There were more males than 
females in emergency and 
transitional shelters.

Males accounted for 112,267, or 
59.4 percent, of the 188,889 people 
in emergency and transitional 
shelters (Table 1). Compared with 
the female population of 76,622, 
this equated to 147 males for every 
100 females in shelters, which was 
comparable to the 140 males for 
every 100 females in the overall GQ 
population but much larger than 
the 96 males for every 100 females 
in the total U.S. population.

Males in emergency and 
transitional shelters represented 
2.3 percent of the male GQ 
population, compared with females 
in emergency and transitional 

shelters, who represented 
2.2 percent of the female GQ 
population. 

The majority of the population 
in emergency and transitional 
shelters were 18 to 64 years old.

There were 143,587 people 
aged 18 to 64 in emergency 
and transitional shelters. This 
accounted for 76.0 percent of 
the shelter population, which 
was slightly higher than the 75.9 
percent of the GQ population aged 
18 to 64 but much greater than the 
61.1 percent of the total population 
aged 18 to 64.

Almost one-sixth of the GQ 
population under the age of 
18 were in emergency and 
transitional shelters.

The age group distributions 
differed between the emergency 
and transitional shelter population 
and the GQ population at younger 
and older ages. Those under the 
age of 18 were 17.5 percent of 
the emergency and transitional 
shelter population, compared with 
2.5 percent of the GQ population 
and 22.1 percent of the total 
population. Accordingly, of people 
younger than the age of 18 who 
lived in GQs, almost one-sixth, 16.4 
percent, were in emergency and 
transitional shelters.

There were more males aged 
65 and over in emergency and 
transitional shelters than females.

For the total U.S. population, 
there were 25.0 million males 
aged 65 and over compared 
with 30.8 million females, or 
81 males to every 100 females. 
The ratio was more skewed for 
the GQ population aged 65 and 
over, where there were 58 males 
to every 100 females. However,

for emergency and transitional 
shelters, there were 189 males to 
every 100 females that were aged 
65 and over. For those under the 
age of 18, there were 106 males 
to 100 females in emergency and 
transitional shelters, 139 males to 
100 females in all GQs, and 105 
males to 100 females in the total 
population. 

Despite a smaller proportion 
of people aged 65 and over, 
the emergency and transitional 
shelters population had a higher 
median age than the total or GQ 
population.

In 2020, 12,186 people, or 6.5 
percent of the emergency and 
transitional shelter population, was 
aged 65 and over. This was smaller 
than the 21.7 percent of the GQ 

population and 16.8 percent of the 
total population that was aged 65 
and over. Despite this, the median 
age of people in shelters was over 
8 years older than people in GQs 
(39.8 years versus 31.5 years) and 
1 year older than people in the 
total population (38.8 years). The 
median age for males in shelters 
(43.6 years) was greater than 
males in the total population 
(37.5 years), despite males aged 
65 and over being 15.4 percent 
of the total male population and 
only 7.1 percent of the males in 
the emergency and transitional 
shelter population. In comparison, 
the percentage of females aged 65 
and over (18.2 percent) in the total 
female population was larger than 
in the emergency and transitional 
shelter female population (5.5 

percent), and the median age for 
females in the total population 
(39.9 years) was greater than 
females in the emergency and 
transitional shelter population 
(34.7 years). 

AGE AND SEX STRUCTURE

illustrate the variation in age and 
sex distributions between the 
emergency and transitional  
shelter population and the total  
U.S. population. The percentages 
of the populations that were male 
or female are shown by single  
year of age (Figure 1). The age  
and sex pyramid for the total  
U.S. population is superimposed

shelter population to present the 
differences between the two.

4 The Emergency and Transitional Shelter Population: 2020 

U.S. Census Bureau 

The youngest ages represented 
larger proportions of the popula-
tion in emergency and transitional 
shelters than in the total popu-
lation but, starting at age 4 for 
females and age 5 for males, the 
proportions in the total population 
were larger. This pattern contin-
ued for both sexes through their 
early 20s until the proportions of 
males in shelters were much larger 
than those in the total population, 
peaking at 57. Most ages beyond 
65 had larger proportions for both 
sexes in the total population than 
in the emergency and transitional 
shelter population.

Females in the total U.S. popula-
tion and in the emergency and 
transitional shelter population had 
similar percentages from their mid-
30s to their mid-50s. Females of 
most ages from their mid-50s and 
older represented larger propor-
tions of the total population than 

the emergency and transitional 
shelter population. 

RACE AND HISPANIC ORIGIN

Most of the emergency and 
transitional shelter population 
reported one race, either Black or 
White.

In 2020, 97.2 percent, or 183,506, 
of the emergency and transitional 
shelter population reported 
one race (Table 2). This was a 
larger percentage than in the GQ 
population (96.4 percent) or the 
total population (89.8 percent). 

A plurality, 46.4 percent of people, 
in emergency and transitional 
shelters were Black or African 
American alone (87,587 people), 
followed by White alone (73,804 
people or 39.1 percent). While 
White alone and Black alone 
populations were roughly equal 
proportions of the shelter 

population, the GQ population and 
the total population were primarily 
White alone (62.0 percent and 61.6 
percent, respectively).

The American Indian and Alaska 
Native alone group accounted 
for 1.9 percent (3,506 people) of 
the emergency and transitional 
shelter population, while the 
Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific 
Islander alone group accounted for 
0.7 percent (1,257 people). Both 
race groups accounted for larger 
proportions of the emergency and 
transitional shelter population than 
of the GQ or total populations. The 
American Indian and Alaska Native 
alone and the Native Hawaiian and 
Other Pacific Islander populations 
accounted for 1.1 percent and 0.3 
percent, respectively, of the GQ 
population, and 1.1 percent and 0.2 
percent, respectively, of the total 
population.

The Emergency and Transitional Shelter Population: 2020  5 

The Asian alone population 
had a smaller proportion in the 
emergency and transitional shelter 
population (1.2 percent) compared 
with the GQ population (4.5 
percent) or the total population 
(6.0 percent). 

In addition, people of Hispanic or 
Latino origin (who may be any 
race) represented 20.6 percent, or 
38,950 people, of the emergency 
and transitional shelter population. 
Both the GQ population and 
the total population had lower 
concentrations of Hispanics 
(14.3 percent and 18.7 percent, 
respectively). Of people in the 
emergency and transitional shelter 
population, 32.1 percent (60,591 
people) reported they were non-
Hispanic White alone. This was 
much lower than the proportion 
of non-Hispanic White alone 
population in the GQ population 
(57.3 percent) and the total 
population (57.8 percent). 

THE EMERGENCY AND 
TRANSITIONAL SHELTER 
POPULATION BY GEOGRAPHY

United States

Nationally, just over half of the 
population in emergency and 
transitional shelters were adult 
males.

At the national level, males and 
females under the age of 18 had 
nearly equal proportions of the 
total emergency and transitional 
shelter population at 9.0 and 8.5 
percent, respectively (Table 3). 
Males aged 18 and over were 50.4 
percent of the national shelter 
population, while females aged 18 
and over were 32.0 percent of the 
population.

Region

The Northeast accounted for the 
largest proportion of the nation’s 
emergency and transitional shelter 
population.

Among the four census regions, 
the largest emergency and 
transitional shelter population 
was in the Northeast (82,757 
or 43.8 percent of the national 
emergency and transitional shelter 
population), followed by the West 
(49,805 or 26.4 percent), the 
South (35,614 or 18.9 percent), 
and the Midwest (20,713 or 11.0 
percent) (Table 4).6

The Northeast had the smallest 
ratio of males to females in 
emergency and transitional 
shelters.

Every region had more males 
than females in emergency 
and transitional shelters, but 
the sex ratios of males to 100 
females varied. In emergency 
and transitional shelters in the 
Northeast, there were 126 males 
for every 100 females. The number 
of males was higher in the other 
regions, with the West having 156 
males, the South 167 males, and 
the Midwest 187 males.

6 The Northeast region includes 
Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, 
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. 
The Midwest includes Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, 
Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, 
Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, 
and Wisconsin. The South includes Alabama, 
Arkansas, Delaware, the District of Columbia, 
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, 
Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, 
Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. The 
West includes Alaska, Arizona, California, 
Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, 
New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and 
Wyoming.

The Northeast had almost 
two-thirds of the juveniles in 
emergency and transitional 
shelters.

The Northeast had the largest 
emergency and transitional shelter 
population in total and by age 
groups under 18 (21,077 or 63.6 
percent of the under-18-years 
shelter population) and 18 and 
over (61,680 or 39.6 percent of the 
18-and-over shelter population). 
The Midwest had the smallest 
emergency and transitional shelter 
population in total and for both 
age groups with 7.9 percent 
(2,603) of those under the age of 
18 and 11.6 percent (18,110) of those 
aged 18 and over.

States

Most people in emergency and 
transitional shelters lived in New 
York and California.

New York had both the largest 
emergency and transitional shelter 
population with 67,739 (35.9 
percent) (Table 4 and Figure 2). 
California was next with 30,245 
(16.0 percent), followed by Texas 
(6,074 or 3.2 percent), Florida 
(5,614 or 3.0 percent), and 
Washington (5,439 or 2.9 percent). 
The District of Columbia and 28 
other states had emergency and 
transitional shelter populations 
between 1,000 and 5,000. 
Seventeen states and Puerto Rico 
had shelter populations of less 
than 1,000.

8 The Emergency and Transitional Shelter Population: 2020 

U.S. Census Bureau 

New York had the largest 
number of males and females 
in emergency and transitional 
shelters.

New York had the largest male 
population (36,935) and female 
population (30,804) in emergency 
and transitional shelters, which 
accounted for 32.9 percent of the 
total male and 40.2 percent of 
the total female emergency and 
transitional shelter population. 
In contrast, Wyoming had the 
smallest male population in 
emergency and transitional 
shelters (73) and North Dakota 
had the smallest female shelter 
population (33). 

New York had a majority of the 
juvenile population in emergency 
and transitional shelters.

For broad age groups, New York 
had the largest emergency and 
transitional shelter population 
under 18 years old (19,173), 
representing 57.9 percent of the 
nation’s juvenile emergency and 
transitional shelter population. In 
addition, New York had the largest 
number of people aged 18 and 
over (48,566) in those shelters, 
accounting for 31.2 percent of 
the nation’s adult emergency and 
transitional shelter population.

Across states, the proportions of 
males and females in emergency 
and transitional shelters varied 
(Figure 3). The state with the 
most uneven distribution was 
Nevada, where 90.9 percent of 
the emergency and transitional 
shelter population was male, which

equates to an average of 1,003 
males for every 100 females. In 
contrast, Utah had an almost equal 
number of males and females 
in shelters, with 50.1 percent 
males. New York, with the largest 
emergency and transitional shelter 

population, had 54.5 percent male 
or 120 males for every 100 females. 
For 13 states and the District of 
Columbia, the proportion of males 
in emergency and transitional 
shelters was smaller than the 
national level (59.4 percent).

10 The Emergency and Transitional Shelter Population: 2020 

U.S. Census Bureau 

New York had the largest 
percentage of juveniles in 
emergency and transitional 
shelters, while Nevada had the 
largest percentage of adults 
in emergency and transitional 
shelters.

New York had the highest 
percentage (28.3 percent) under 
18 years old in emergency and 
transitional shelters, followed 
by Wyoming (27.4 percent) 
(Figure 4). Only six states and 
the District of Columbia had 
higher proportions of juveniles in 
the emergency and transitional 
shelters than the national level 
(17.5 percent). Nevada and Alaska 
had the highest percentages in 
the 18 years old and over age 
group with 99.2 percent and 98.0 
percent, respectively. 

Most states had larger male 
juvenile and male adult 
populations in emergency and 
transitional shelters.

The distribution of age and sex 
varies by state (Table 3). There 
were higher proportions of male 
than female juveniles in 35 states, 
the District of Columbia, and 
Puerto Rico. North Carolina had 
a higher proportion of males 
under 18 years old (12.6 percent) 
than females (7.6 percent), while 
Delaware had the opposite pattern 
(6.1 percent male, 8.6 percent 
female). For the 18 years old and 
over age group, Nevada had the 
highest disproportionate share of 
males, with over ten times as many 

males as females. Only two states 
had emergency and transitional 
shelter populations with more 
females than males aged 18 and 
over: Utah (39.0 percent male, 41.2 
percent female) and South Dakota 
(42.5 percent male, 45.6 percent 
female). These disproportionate 
age and sex relationships 
across states are noteworthy 
because they highlight important 
demographic contrasts; however, 
these patterns are apparent in 
states where the total emergency 
and transitional shelter populations 
were already small, therefore, the 
data should be used with caution.

Counties

Viewing the emergency and 
transitional shelter population from 
a spatial perspective, a county-
level map provides more detail 
about their patterns in the United 
States and Puerto Rico (Figure 
5).7 Clusters of counties with the 

7 The primary legal divisions of most 
states are termed “counties.” In Louisiana, 
these divisions are known as parishes. 
In Alaska, which has no counties, the 
statistically equivalent entities are census 
areas, cities, and boroughs (as in Juneau City 
and Borough, a municipality [Anchorage], 
and organized boroughs). Census areas 
are delineated cooperatively for data 
presentation purposes by the state of 
Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four 
states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and 
Virginia), there are one or more incorporated 
places that are independent of any county 
organization and, thus, constitute primary 
divisions of their states. These incorporated 
places are known as “independent cities” 
and are treated as equivalent to counties 
for data presentation purposes. The District 
of Columbia has no primary divisions, and 
the entire area is considered equivalent to 
a county and a state for data presentation 
purposes.

largest populations in emergency 
and transitional shelters were 
along the nation’s Atlantic and 
Pacific coasts. Specifically, large 
populations were found in a swath 
along the Atlantic coast from 
New England to the Mid-Atlantic 
Corridor and in Florida. In the 
West, bands of coastal counties 
from the Pacific Northwest to 
the Desert Southwest had large 
populations, along with some 
counties in Hawaii. 

Throughout the interior of the 
United States, counties with large 
emergency and transitional shelter 
populations were generally located 
in and around metropolitan 
areas. Moderate and small-sized 
populations were concentrated 
in the interior of New England 
and continued into the Ohio River 
Valley and parts of the upper 
Midwest, along with concentrations 
in North Carolina, South Carolina, 
and Georgia. Aside from many of 
the Great Plains states, pockets of 
counties with moderate and small-
sized emergency and transitional 
shelter populations existed in 
states representing the Heartland, 
the Appalachian Mountains, 
the Mississippi Delta, Texas and 
Oklahoma, and the Intermountain 
West.

transitional shelter populations 
were in New York: Bronx County 
with 19,992, New York County 
with 16,502, Kings County with 
15,487, and Queens County with 
11,244 (Table 5). The fifth largest

New York city also had the largest 
percentage of the GQ population 
in emergency and transitional 
shelters.

In New York city, 29.0 percent 
of its GQ population was in 
emergency and transitional 
shelters, the largest of any place 
with a total population of 100,000 
or more (Table 7).8 In both San 
Mateo, CA, and Lansing, MI, 
more than one-fifth of their GQ 
populations were in emergency 
and transition shelters, with their 
percentages being 20.9 and 20.6, 
respectively. In addition, the 
California cities of Fremont (18.9 
percent), Norwalk (15.2 percent), 
and Sunnyvale (14.7 percent) were 
in the top ten.

METHODOLOGY AND 
SOURCES OF DATA

This report uses 2020 decennial 
census data. For readability, 
large whole numbers in the text 
are expressed in millions. Whole 
numbers in tables and under 1 
million in the text are unrounded. 
All derived values are computed 
using unrounded data and then 
rounded to tenths, except sex 
ratios, which are rounded to whole 
numbers. In the map, data are 
categorized based on unrounded 
data.

ABOUT THE 2020 CENSUS

Why was the 2020 Census 
conducted?

The U.S. Constitution mandates 
that a census be taken in the 
United States every 10 years. 
This is required to determine 
the number of seats each state 
receives in the U.S. House 
of Representatives. The GQ 

8 There were 340 places in the 2020 
Census with a population of 100,000 or 
more. They included 322 incorporated places 
(including five city/county consolidations) 
and 18 Census Bureau designated places that 
were not legally incorporated.

population, and specifically 
the population in emergency 
and transitional shelters, is an 
important element of the  
U.S. population.

How are these data beneficial?

The purpose of the census is to 
produce an accurate and complete 
count of the population of the 
United States. These data provide 
information on the population 
in emergency and transitional 
shelters for people experiencing 
homelessness, and give us 
valuable insights into the size 
and demographic characteristics 
of this population, as well as 
its geographic distribution. It 
is important to note, however, 
that for a variety of reasons, the 
population discussed here should 
not be interpreted as representing 
the entire population experiencing 
homelessness. The purpose of 
this special report is to provide 
a snapshot of the population 
enumerated in emergency and 

transitional shelters at the time of 
the 2020 Census.

How are data collected in the 
2020 Census protected from 
disclosure? 

To protect respondent 
confidentiality, data have 
undergone disclosure avoidance 
methods that add “statistical 
noise”—small random additions 
or subtractions—to the data 
so that no one can reliably link 
the published data to a specific 
person or household. The Census 
Bureau encourages data users to 
aggregate small populations and 
geographies to improve accuracy 
and diminish implausible results. 
While statistical noise is used 
to protect data from disclosure 
while preserving valid statistical 
outcomes, there are three data 
points where statistical noise is 
not applied in order to preserve 
these “as reported” counts. These 
data points are referred to as 
“invariants,” and one such invariant
