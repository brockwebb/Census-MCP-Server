We ask questions about when a housing unit was built and

when a person moved into that home to create statistics about

housing age and availability.

Local, state, tribal, and federal agencies use these data in

government programs to analyze whether adequate housing is

available and affordable for residents, provide and fund

housing assistance programs, and measure neighborhood

stability.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci

and law enforcement.

Questions as they appear on the form

We ask two questions about when a housing unit was built, and when a person moved into that
home to produce statistics about housing availability.

Year built and year moved in data help communities:

Provide Adequate Housing

We ask about the age of housing in a community to understand whether available housing meets the needs of residents. When

housing is not sufﬁcient or older than a certain age, housing data help communities:

Enroll eligible households in programs designed to assist them (such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program).
Qualify for grants from the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships Program, Emergency Solutions

Grants (ESG), Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA), and other programs.

Plan Community Development

Information about the ages of homes in combination with whether they are occupied or vacant, helps communities identify

opportunities to:

Improve tax, assistance, and zoning policies.
Reduce tax revenue losses from vacant or abandoned properties.
Find older structures in disaster-prone areas during emergency planning and preparation.

Knowing more about the age of the housing stock in combination with the ﬁnancial situation of residents, including income,
employment, and housing costs, can help communities:

Qualify for loan and grant programs designed to stimulate economic recovery.
Improve housing.
Start and maintain job-training programs.
Define areas as empowerment or enterprise zones.

History of year built and year moved in questions

Year built originated with the 1940 Census, while year moved in originated with the 1960 Census. They were transferred to the

ACS in 2005 when it replaced the decennial census long form.
