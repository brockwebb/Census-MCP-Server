Home Value Estimates in
Current Dollars

September 2023

Starting with the 2022 data releases, reported home value collected on the American Community Survey (ACS) will be

presented in current year dollars. This adjustment will use the Retroactive Consumer Price Index Research Series (R-

CPI-U-RS), formerly known as the CPI-U-RS, which is used to adjust all other dollar-denominated estimates in the ACS.

This change will bring the home value data in line with how all other dollar-denominated housing and income items

are adjusted to real (i.e., constant) dollars.

For the 2022 ACS 1-year estimates, this change will impact how estimates for home value are presented in the CP04

tables. The data populating the prior periods (2021, 2019, and 2018) will be adjusted to 2022 dollars. Additionally, the

medians will be adjusted in a similar method as other dollar-based medians, as described in the following user note:

surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2022-08.html] .

For the 5-year estimates, the four prior years (2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018) will be adjusted to the current yearâ€™s dollars
when creating the 2018-2022 ACS 5-year estimate. This change will impact the CP04 table and the following Detailed
Tables:

B25075-B25083 (including B25077A-I), B25085, B25096, B25097, B25100, B25107-B25110, and B25121

Users should use caution when comparing 2018-2022 ACS 5-year estimates from the tables listed above to their prior
period estimates, as the differences will represent changes in reported home values as well as inter-year R-CPI-U-RS
adjustments.
