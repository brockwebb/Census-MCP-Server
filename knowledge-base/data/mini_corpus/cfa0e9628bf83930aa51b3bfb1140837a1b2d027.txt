We ask questions about health insurance coverage to create

statistics about the percentage of people covered by health

insurance and the sources of health insurance.

Local, state, tribal, and federal agencies use health insurance

coverage data to plan government programs, determine

eligibility criteria, and encourage eligible people to participate in

health insurance programs.

Health insurance coverage data help communities:

Provide Assistance to Children and Families

We ask about health insurance coverage status in combination with other information, such as number and age of children in

families, household income, and poverty status, to help communities enroll eligible families in programs designed to assist them

For example, health insurance coverage status and age data are used to encourage eligible people to enroll in Marketplace,

Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Health insurance data are also used to ensure that these

programs are improving health outcomes for families.

Provide Health Care for Veterans

We ask about the number and characteristics of veterans eligible to use Department of Veterans Affairs health care, compared to

those currently using services, to help communities and the federal government estimate the future demand for health care

services and facilities for veterans.

Provide Health Care for American Indians

We ask about the health insurance coverage of American Indians to help communities, tribes, and the federal government

estimate the demand for health care through the Indian Health Service.

Understand Changes

We ask about the health insurance coverage status of people in a community to help planners:

Identify gaps in community services.
Plan programs that address those gaps.
Qualify for funding for those programs.

Researchers, advocacy groups, and policymakers are also interested in knowing more about changes in health insurance

coverage rates and the characteristics of people who have or do not have health insurance. For example, State Councils on
Developmental Disabilities use health insurance coverage data in their comprehensive reviews and analyses of the unmet need

of people with developmental disabilities.

History of health insurance coverage question

The health insurance coverage question was added to the ACS in 2008. In 2019, questions about health insurance premiums an
subsidies were added to the ACS. Research about these questions [https://www.census.gov/library/working-

papers/2017/acs/2017_Berchick_01.html] and copies of previous questionnaires [https://www.census.gov/programs-

surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaire-archive.2018.html] are available on the ACS website.
