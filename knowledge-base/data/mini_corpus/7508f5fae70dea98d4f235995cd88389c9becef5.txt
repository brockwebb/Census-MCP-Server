Originally posted September 14, 2017; Updated December 7, 2017

The rows presented in American Community Survey tables B16001, C16001, and B16002 have been

updated to reflect changes in the number of people speaking different languages. Geographic
restrictions have been placed on the 5-year estimates for table B16001, to protect the privacy of

speakers of smaller languages.Â  For more information and guidance in comparing estimates from the

2015 and 2016 language tables, please see the user note below:
