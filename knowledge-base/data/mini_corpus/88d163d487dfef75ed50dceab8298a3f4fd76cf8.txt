An API, or “Application Programming
Interface,” is a tool that programmers

can use to access data more
efficiently. It reduces the need for

data storage and provides software
developers, data scientists, and
others with a set of standard
commands to easily access
statistics that can be incorporated

into their programs and applications.

This guide provides an overview of
the Census Data API and how it can
be used to access data from the U.S.
Census Bureau’s American
Community Survey (ACS), a source

of up-to-date statistics on the social,
economic, housing, and
demographic characteristics of
America’s communities.

The guide is intended for software
developers and researchers who
want to access ACS data to create
mobile- or Web-based apps, as well
as nonprogrammers who want to
create simple queries to access ACS
data through an Internet browser.

More detailed instructions on how to
use the Census Data API are
available in the Census
Bureau’s Census Data API User
Guide
