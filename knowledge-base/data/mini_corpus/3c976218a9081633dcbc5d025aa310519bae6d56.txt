We ask questions about whether a person moved in the last

year and where he or she lived 1 year ago to create statistics

about where people are moving (to/from places within the

United States and from foreign countries).

Migration (residence 1 year ago) data are used in planning

government programs and adjusting other important

geographic data as people move. The characteristics of people

who have moved are also an important part of estimating

population changes. These population estimates are used in

funding decisions, to ensure surveys are accurate, to

understand change in other data, and to produce ofﬁcial

international migration estimates.

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

Residence 1 year ago/migration data help communities:

Understand Change

Information on the characteristics of people who have moved and the patterns of migration (where people

move to and from) is an important part of estimating population changes. Population estimates are used in

funding decisions, to ensure surveys are accurate, to understand change in other data, and to produce

international migration estimates. These data also help agencies assess residential stability and the effects of

migration on urban and rural areas.

Information on where certain populations move to and from helps federal agencies assess the needs of
counties with large refugee populations and the effects of immigration on local areas.

Information on the characteristics of people who live or have lived in certain areas is important to understand

the relationships among different development patterns, including housing and travel information, public health,
and pollution. State and local agencies use these statistics to develop programs that attract new residents or

employers.

History of residence 1 year ago/migration question

The residence 1 year ago/migration question originated with the 1930 Census. It was transferred to the ACS in
2005 when it replaced the decennial census long form.
