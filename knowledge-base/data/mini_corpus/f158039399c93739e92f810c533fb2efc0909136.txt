iv Poverty in the United States: 2023 

U.S. Census Bureau 

Poverty in the United States: 2023

INTRODUCTION

The U.S. Census Bureau pro-
duces annual poverty estimates 
to measure the economic well-
being of households, families, and 
individuals in the United States. 
This report provides estimates 
of two measures of poverty: the 
official poverty measure and the 
Supplemental Poverty Measure 
(SPM). The official poverty mea-
sure, produced since the 1960s, 
defines poverty by comparing 
pretax money income to a national 
poverty threshold adjusted by 
family composition.1, 2 The official 
poverty measure is used as an 
input to determine eligibility for 
several government programs and 
has been used as a benchmark 
of economic well-being since its 
adoption.

The SPM, produced in collabora-
tion with the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS), extends the offi-
cial poverty measure by account-
ing for several government pro-
grams that are designed to assist 
low-income families but are not 
included in official poverty mea-
sure calculations. The SPM also 
accounts for geographic varia-
tion in housing expenses when 
calculating poverty thresholds 
and includes federal and state 
taxes, work expenses, and medi-
cal expenses. The SPM has been 
released annually since 2011, with 
estimates going back to 2009. It 
does not replace the official pov-
erty measure, but rather provides 
a different metric of economic 
well-being that includes resources 

from government programs and 
tax credits to low-income families.*

The estimates in this report 
are based on data collected in 
the 2024 and earlier Current 
Population Survey Annual Social 
and Economic Supplements (CPS 
ASEC) conducted by the Census 
Bureau. This report is released 
alongside two other reports 
focused on household income 
and health insurance coverage in 
the United States: “Income in the 
United States: 2023” and “Health 
Insurance in the United States: 
2023.”3

Highlights

Official Poverty Measure

•  In 2023, the official poverty rate 
fell 0.4 percentage points to 11.1 
percent. There were 36.8 million 
people in poverty in 2023, not 
statistically different from 2022 
(Figure 1 and Table A-1).4

•  Between 2022 and 2023, the 

official poverty rate decreased 
for White and non-Hispanic 
White individuals; women; 18- to 
64-year-olds; unrelated indi-
viduals; all workers; less than

full-time, year-round workers; 
and those with some college. 
The only group to experience a 
statistically significant increase 
in their official poverty rate was 
the Two or More Races popula-
tion (Figure 2 and Tables A-1 
and A-2). 

The Supplemental Poverty 
Measure (SPM)

•  The SPM rate in 2023 was 12.9 
percent, an increase of 0.5 
percentage points from 2022 
(Figure 4 and Table B-3). 

•  The SPM child poverty rate 

increased 1.3 percentage points 
to 13.7 percent in 2023. The SPM 
rates for 18- to 64-year-olds and 
people 65 years and older were 
not statistically different from 
2022 (Figure 4 and Table B-3).5  

•  SPM rates increased between 
2022 and 2023 for Asian and 
Hispanic (any race) individuals 
and for those reporting Two or 
More Races. SPM rates did not 
change significantly for White, 
non-Hispanic White, Black, or 
American Indian and Alaska 
Native individuals (Figure 4 and 
Table B-3).6

•  Social Security continues to be 

the largest antipoverty program, 
moving 27.6 million individu-
als out of SPM poverty in 2023 
(Figure 10 and Table B-7). 

Differences in Poverty Measures

•  The share of the population with 
resources below 50 percent 
of their poverty threshold was 
higher using the official pov-
erty measure with a consistent

universe (5.2 percent) than 
when using the SPM (4.4 per-
cent) (Figure 9 and Table B-5).7

•  In 2023, most of the groups dis-
cussed in this report had higher 
SPM rates than official poverty 
rates with a consistent universe 
(Figure 7 and Table B-4). 

Background

The Census Bureau has pro-
duced poverty estimates since 
the 1960s. Following the Office of 
Management and Budget’s (OMB) 
Statistical Policy Directive 14, the 
official poverty measure classi-
fies families and individuals as 
in poverty if their pretax money 
income falls below a threshold 
adjusted by family composition. 
Poverty thresholds are adjusted 
annually for inflation using the 
Consumer Price Index for All Urban 
Consumers (CPI-U). The official 

poverty measure can be used to 
evaluate economic well-being back 
to 1959. Appendix A provides more 
information on the official poverty 
measure.

The SPM was developed after 
years of research and analysis. It is 
based on the recommendations of 
the Interagency Technical Working 
Group (ITWG) on Developing a 
Supplemental Poverty Measure 
and the 1995 report of the National 
Academy of Sciences Panel on 
Poverty and Family Assistance. 
The SPM complements the official 
poverty measure by expanding 
the definition of resources to 
include noncash benefits while 
deducting key expenses. The SPM 
also uses poverty thresholds that 
account for a wider set of needs 
and geographic variation than 
the official poverty thresholds.8 

Additionally, it accounts for 
housing tenure by using different 
thresholds for renters, owners 
with a mortgage, and those who 
have substantially lower housing 
costs, either because they do not 
pay rent or are owners without a 
mortgage.

In addition to the differences in 
resources and thresholds, the offi-
cial poverty measure and the SPM 
use different measurement units 
and universes. The official poverty 
measure assumes that only indi-
viduals related by birth, marriage, 
and adoption (i.e., census-defined 
families) share resources. This 
resource-sharing unit is used to 
sum resources and determine the 
appropriate poverty threshold. 
In comparison, the SPM expands 
the resource-sharing unit to also 
include family members, unmarried

partners and their relatives, coresi-
dent unrelated children under 
the age of 15, and foster children 
under the age of 22. Because of 
these differences, official poverty 
measure estimates are reported for 
families, while SPM estimates are 
reported for resource units. Both 
measures also provide estimates 
for unrelated individuals.9

The difference in measurement 
unit also leads to a difference in 
universe: the SPM includes unre-
lated children under the age of 15, 
while the official poverty measure 
does not. To account for this differ-
ence, this report uses the designa-
tion “official+” when directly com-
paring the official and SPM poverty 
measures. Estimates of official+ 
poverty add unrelated individuals 

under the age of 15 to the official 
poverty universe. These individuals 
are given the official poverty status 
of the household reference person.

changes, as well as data 
processing and methodological 
improvements.10

The SPM does not replace the 
official poverty measure, nor is it 
designed to be used for program 
eligibility or funding distribution. 
The main differences in the two 
measures are summarized in the 
“Differences in Poverty Measures” 
table. Updates to the SPM for 
2023 can be found in Appendix B.

OFFICIAL POVERTY BY 
SELECTED CHARACTERISTICS

In 2023, the official poverty rate 
fell 0.4 percentage points to 
11.1 percent, the first statistically 
significant change in the official 
poverty rate since 2020 (Figure 
1 and Table A-1). There were 36.8 
million people in poverty in 2023, 
not statistically different from 
2022. Of the demographic groups 
presented in Figure 2, only one—
individuals reporting Two or More 
Races—experienced an increase in 
poverty in 2023. Official poverty 
rates for the other demographic 
groups either decreased or were

not statistically different from 
2022. Estimates for additional 
demographic and family groups 
are available in Tables A-1 and A-2.

Sex and Age

The official poverty rate for women 
fell 0.5 percentage points to 11.9 
percent in 2023 but remained 
higher than the rate for men (10.2 
percent). The poverty rate for men 
was not statistically different from 
2022 (Figure 2 and Table A-1).

Among the age groups in Figure 
2, only 18- to 64-year-olds expe-
rienced a significant change in 
poverty between 2022 and 2023, 
declining 0.6 percentage points to 
10.0 percent in 2023. People under 
18 years old had a higher pov-
erty rate (15.3 percent) than both 
18- to 64-year-olds (10.0 percent) 
and those 65 years and older (9.7 
percent).11

Type of Unit12

Official poverty rates did not 
change significantly for people 
in families, regardless of family 
type (Figure 2 and Table A-2). 
Of people in families, those in 
married-couple families had the 
lowest poverty rate (5.2 percent), 
while those in female-householder 
families had the highest (23.6 
percent).13 

Poverty rates for unrelated individ-
uals decreased by 0.9 percentage 
points between 2022 and 2023 to 
19.2 percent. 

Race and Hispanic Origin14, 15

From 2022 to 2023, only the 
White, non-Hispanic White, and 
Two or More Races populations 
saw significant changes in their 
official poverty rates. The poverty 
rate for White individuals declined 

by 0.7 percentage points to 
9.7 percent, while the rate for 
non-Hispanic White individuals 
declined by 0.9 percentage points 
to 7.7 percent.16 The poverty rate 
increased by 2.2 percentage points 
to 14.4 percent for those reporting 
Two or More Races (Figure 2 and 
Table A-1). Poverty rates for Black, 
Asian, American Indian and Alaska 
Native, and Hispanic (any race) 
individuals were not statistically 
different from 2022.17

Of the race and Hispanic origin 
groups shown in Figure 2 and 
Table A-1, poverty rates were 
highest for American Indian and 
Alaska Native (21.2 percent) and 
Black individuals (17.9 percent).18 
The poverty rate was lowest for 
non-Hispanic White individuals (7.7 
percent). 

Figure 3 shows the composition of 
the total population by race and 
Hispanic origin. This figure high-
lights which groups were over-
represented or underrepresented 
among the population in poverty 
by comparing the share of a par-
ticular group in poverty to that 
group’s share of the overall popu-
lation. Groups with a ratio of less 
than 1.0 were underrepresented 
in poverty while groups above 
1.0 were overrepresented. For 
example, while non-Hispanic White 
individuals made up 58.1 percent 
of the total population, they only 
made up 40.5 percent of the popu-
lation classified as poor by the offi-
cial poverty measure. As shown in 
the bottom panel of Figure 3, this 
results in a ratio of 0.7, indicating 
that non-Hispanic White individu-
als were underrepresented in the 
poverty population. Asian individu-
als were also underrepresented 
in the poverty population, while 
Hispanic (any race), Black, Two or 

More Races, and American Indian 
and Alaska Native individuals were 
overrepresented.19

Educational Attainment20

Poverty rates by educational 
attainment for those 25 years 
and older are shown in Figure 
2. Between 2022 and 2023, the 
official poverty rate decreased 0.9 
percentage points to 8.5 percent 
for those with some college edu-
cation (Figure 2 and Table A-1). 
Poverty rates were not statisti-
cally different for the rest of the 
educational groups. Those without 
a high school diploma had the 
highest poverty rate (25.1 percent), 
while those with at least a bach-
elor’s degree had the lowest rate 
(4.0 percent). 

Work Experience

From 2022 to 2023, the official 
poverty rate for all 18- to 64-year-
old workers declined by 0.3 
percentage points to 4.5 percent. 
The poverty rate fell 1.1 percentage 
points for those who worked less 
than full-time, year-round to 11.7 
percent. In 2023, full-time, year-
round workers had the lowest pov-
erty rate (1.8 percent), while those 
who did not work had the highest 
(29.7 percent). Neither rate was 
significantly different from 2022.

THE SUPPLEMENTAL 
POVERTY MEASURE (SPM)

The official poverty measure 
provides a consistent definition 
of poverty over long periods by 
considering pretax money income 
alone and using thresholds that are 
only inflation-adjusted. It does not 
capture tax policy, noncash assis-
tance, geographic cost-of-living 
differences, necessary expenses, or 
changes over time in any of these 
components.

5 Poverty in the United States: 2023 

U.S. Census Bureau 

As the SPM demonstrates, these 
factors can have a significant effect 
on poverty rates. The rest of this 
report explores poverty using the 
SPM. The SPM provides an addi-
tional perspective on economic 
well-being by expanding the defini-
tion of official poverty to include 
noncash benefits, account for 
income and payroll taxes, subtract 
other necessary expenses, use a 
more inclusive resource sharing 
unit, and account for geographic 
differences in housing costs. 

The remainder of this report uses 
official+ when drawing comparisons 
between the SPM and the official 
poverty measure. Official+ denotes 
the official poverty measure using 
the same universe as the SPM, 
which includes unrelated individu-
als under the age of 15. Using offi-
cial+ allows for direct comparisons 
of the two concepts with the same 
reference universe. 

SPM by Selected Characteristics

In 2023, the overall SPM rate was 
12.9 percent, 0.5 percentage points 
higher than in 2022. This was 
the second consecutive annual 
increase in the SPM rate (Table 
B-2). 

Figure 4 presents annual SPM rates 
for 2022 and 2023 across a set 
of demographic characteristics. 
Estimates for additional demo-
graphic groups are available in 
Table B-3. 

Sex and Age

SPM rates increased by 0.5 per-
centage points for both men and 
women in 2023.21 The SPM rate 
for women (13.4 percent) was 
higher than the rate for men (12.4 
percent). 

In 2023, the SPM rate increased 1.3 
percentage points for those under 
18 years old to 13.7 percent. SPM 
rates for both 18- to 64-year-olds

(12.2 percent) and those 65 years 
and older (14.2 percent) were not 
statistically different from 2022.22

was 5.7 percent, while the rate for 
owners with no mortgage was 11.5 
percent. 

Housing Tenure

Between 2022 and 2023, SPM rates 
increased for renters, but were not 
statistically different for owners, 
regardless of whether they had a 
mortgage. The SPM rate for renters 
increased 1.7 percentage points to 
23.9 percent, the highest SPM rate 
among the three groups. The SPM 
rate for owners with a mortgage 

SPM thresholds are adjusted sepa-
rately for the three housing tenure 
groups. SPM thresholds for rent-
ers increased 8.6 percent between 
2022 and 2023, compared to 7.8 
percent for owners with a mort-
gage and 6.8 percent for owners 
without a mortgage.23 SPM thresh-
olds for 2022 and 2023 are avail-
able in Table B-1.

Race and Hispanic Origin

SPM rates increased between 2022 
and 2023 for three of the race and 
Hispanic origin groups presented 
in Figure 4: Asian, Two or More 
Races, and Hispanic (any race). 
SPM rates for White, non-Hispanic 
White, Black, and American Indian 
and Alaska Native individuals did 
not change significantly. Non-
Hispanic White individuals had 
the lowest SPM rate (8.8 percent), 
while American Indian and Alaska 
Native (19.0 percent) and Hispanic 
(20.9 percent) individuals had the 
highest.24

Figure 5 shows historical SPM rates 
for children by race and Hispanic 
origin (Table B-2).25 After pov-
erty rates for non-Hispanic White, 
Black, and Hispanic children fell 
to historic lows in 2021 due to 

pandemic-era policies that tar-
geted families with children, SPM 
rates for children of all races in 
the figure began to rise in 2022 as 
those policies ended.26 They rose 
further for Hispanic (any race), 
Black, and Asian children between 
2022 and 2023.27 The SPM rate for 
non-Hispanic White children did 
not change significantly between 
2022 and 2023. 

Educational Attainment

Between 2022 and 2023, the SPM 
rate for those 25 years and older 
without a high school diploma 
increased 3.0 percentage points to 
30.9 percent (Figure 4 and Table 
B-3). This is the highest SPM rate 
among the presented education 
groups. Those with at least a bach-
elor’s degree had the lowest SPM 

rate (5.9 percent). SPM rates for 
those with a high school diploma 
(16.1 percent), some college (10.7 
percent), and a bachelor’s degree 
or higher did not change signifi-
cantly from year to year. 

Work Experience 

From 2022 to 2023, SPM rates 
increased for all workers 18 to 64 
years old; those who worked full-
time, year-round; and those who 
did not work. The SPM rate for 
those working less than full-time, 
year-round (14.7 percent) did not 
significantly change. Full-time, 
year-round workers had the lowest 
SPM rate (4.1 percent), while those 
who did not work had the highest 
(31.1 percent). The SPM rate for all 
18- to 64-year-old workers was 7.0 
percent in 2023.

POVERTY ESTIMATES FOR 
2023: OFFICIAL+ AND SPM

Figure 6 presents SPM and 
official+ estimates from 2009 to 
2023.28 The overall SPM rate (12.9 
percent) was 1.8 percentage points 
higher than the official+ rate (11.1 
percent) in 2023 (Table B-4). 
This is an increase from the 0.9 
percentage-point gap between 
measures in 2022, which is largely 
due to a difference in how the 
poverty thresholds are adjusted 
each year.29 Between 2022 and 
2023, base SPM thresholds—
those adjusted for housing tenure 
but not geographic location or 
family composition—increased 
between 6.8 and 8.6 percent, while 
the official poverty thresholds 
increased 4.1 percent.30

Figure 7 displays the difference 
in poverty rates between the two 
poverty measures for the selected 

demographic characteristics. SPM 
rates were higher than official+ 
rates for most groups in the figure 
but were lower for children and 
cohabiting partners. Official+ and 
SPM rates were not statistically 
different for the Black, American 
Indian and Alaska Native, and Two 
or More Races populations. 

Figure 8 shows official+ and SPM 
rates from 2009 to 2023 by age 
(Table B-2). In 2023, the SPM rate 
for children (13.7 percent) was 
lower than the official+ rate (15.2 
percent). The gap between the 
two measures continued to narrow 
(down to 1.5 percentage points in 
2023) following a 10.1 percentage-
point gap in 2021. The large gap 
in 2021 resulted from the inclusion 
of pandemic-era tax and noncash 
benefit program expansions. These 
are included in the SPM but not 
the official poverty measure, which 

only includes money income. The 
subsequent narrowing in 2022 was 
due in part to the expiration of 
those pandemic-era programs. 

The SPM rate was higher than the 
official+ rate for both adult age 
groups. The SPM rate for 18- to 
64-year-olds was 12.2 percent, 
while the official+ rate was 10.0 
percent. Those 65 years and older 
had the largest gap between mea-
sures (4.4 percentage points), with 
an SPM rate of 14.2 percent and 
an official+ rate of 9.7 percent.31 
The larger gap among those 65 
years and older was primarily due 
to differences in the treatment of 
medical expenses between the two 
measures—medical expenses are 
subtracted from resources in the 
SPM but are not accounted for in 
the official poverty measure.

DISTRIBUTION OF PEOPLE 
BY INCOME-TO-POVERTY 
RATIOS: 2023

The methodological differences 
between the official poverty 
measure and the SPM not only 
result in different poverty rates, 
but also affect the entire distribu-
tion of income-to-poverty ratios. 
These ratios indicate how close 
someone’s income or resources 
are to the poverty line by dividing 
their resources by their poverty 

threshold. If the resulting ratio is 
below 0.5, for example, it indi-
cates that income or resources fall 
below 50 percent of the poverty 
threshold; if it were more than 2.0, 
it would indicate that income or 
resources were more than twice 
the poverty threshold. Figure 
9 compares the distribution of 
the SPM and official+ measure’s 
income-to-poverty ratio categories 
for the total population and major 
age categories (Table B-5).32

A smaller share of the total popu-
lation had incomes below half of 
their poverty threshold using the 
SPM (4.4 percent) than the official+ 
methodology (5.2 percent). In the 
middle of the distribution, more 
individuals had income-to-poverty 
ratios in the 0.50 to 0.99, 1.00 to 
1.99, and 2.00 to 3.99 ratio cat-
egories when using the SPM than 
when using the official+ measure. 
At the top of the distribution, 
about twice as many people had 
incomes 4.00 or more times the

poverty threshold using the offi-
cial+ measure (44.5 percent) than 
using the SPM (22.5 percent).

These patterns are to be expected. 
Receiving government assistance 
and tax credits, which the SPM 
accounts for but the official+ meth-
odology does not, pulls incomes 
up at the bottom of the income 
distribution. Paying out taxes and 
other necessary expenses—also 
accounted for in the SPM but 
not the official+ measure—pulls 
incomes down from the top of the 
distribution, reducing the percent-
age of people with income in the 
highest category in the SPM. 

Considering age, the share of 
people with income-to-poverty 
ratios below half their poverty 
threshold was lower when using 
the SPM than the official+ measure 
for children and 18- to 64-year-olds 
but was higher when using the 
SPM for those 65 years and older. 
Many of the noncash benefits 
included in the SPM are targeted 
at families with children or pro-
vide a larger benefit when chil-
dren are present, like tax credits 
and the Supplemental Nutritional 
Assistance Program (SNAP). As a 
result, the share of children with 
resources below 50 percent of 
their SPM threshold (3.6 percent) 

was the lowest of the three age 
groups, followed by 18- to 64-year-
olds (4.4 percent). The share of 
those 65 and older with resources 
below 50 percent of their SPM 
threshold was 5.3 percent in 2023.

NONCASH TRANSFERS,

A main contribution of the SPM is 
that it allows us to estimate how

expenses affect the number of 
people in poverty and the poverty 
rate. Figure 10 (Tables B-6 and

13 Poverty in the United States: 2023 

U.S. Census Bureau 

B-7) shows how adding or sub-
tracting different factors from the 
resource calculation would affect 
the number of people in poverty 
in 2023. Some of the programs in 
the figure—such as Social Security 
and unemployment insurance 
benefits—are included in both the 
official poverty measure and the 
SPM. Others—such as refundable 
tax credits, SNAP, and school lunch 
benefits—are only included in the 
SPM. Necessary expenses—such 
as taxes, medical expenses, and 
work-related expenses—are also 
deducted from SPM resources but 
are not considered in the official 
poverty measure.34

To evaluate the effect of programs 
that add to resources (e.g., Social 
Security and cash and noncash 
transfers), we subtract the value 
of each component from a unit’s 
resources and recalculate poverty 
status. In contrast, to evaluate the 
effect of expenses, we add back 
the value of each component to 
a unit’s resources. Poverty status 
changes if subtracting a program 
benefit decreases an individual’s 
resources below their poverty 
threshold or if adding an expense 
takes them above their poverty 
threshold. These additions and 
subtractions are done indepen-
dently and assume no behavioral 
changes such as shifts in employ-
ment status or expenses. 

Removing one item from the 
calculation of SPM resources and 
recalculating poverty rates shows, 
for example, that Social Security 
benefits decreased the SPM rate 
by 8.3 percentage points (Table 
B-6), lifting 27.6 million people 
above the poverty line (Figure 10 
and Table B-7). Social Security was 
the largest antipoverty program 
in 2023, especially for those 65 
years and older. Approximately 70 
percent of the people pulled out 
of poverty by Social Security (19.5 

million individuals) fell into that 
age group. 

decreased or were not statistically 
different from 2022. 

Of the additions to the SPM 
resources calculation, refundable 
tax credits had the second-largest 
effect, lifting 6.4 million people 
above the poverty line in 2023, 
including 3.4 million children. 
About a third of the individuals 
pulled above the poverty line by 
refundable tax credits were pulled 
above the poverty line by the 
refundable portion of the fed-
eral Child Tax Credit (2.4 million 
individuals). 

The SPM subtracts amounts 
paid for child support, income 
and payroll taxes, work-related 
expenses, and medical expenses 
from resources, which increases 
the number and percentage of 
individuals in poverty.35 Of the 
subtractions, medical expenses 
had the largest effect, pushing 7.4 
million individuals into poverty in 
2023. This effect varied by age. 
For those 65 years and older, sub-
tracting medical expenses raised 
the poverty rate by 3.8 percent-
age points. The effect was smaller 
among children (1.9 percentage 
points) and 18- to 64-year-olds (1.9 
percentage points).36

SUMMARY

This report provides estimates of 
poverty in the United States using 
both the official poverty measure 
and the SPM.

In 2023, the official poverty rate 
fell to 11.1 percent, down from 
11.5 percent in 2022. This was 
the first statistically significant 
change in the official poverty rate 
since 2020. Of the demographic 
groups presented in this report, 
only those reporting Two or More 
Races had a higher poverty rate in 
2023. Official poverty rates for the 
other demographic groups either 

The SPM rate increased 0.5 per-
centage points in 2023 to 12.9 
percent. This was the second 
consecutive year that SPM rates 
increased. Between 2022 and 
2023, SPM rates either increased 
or did not change significantly for 
every demographic group in this 
report. 

The results illustrate how using 
different definitions of poverty 
affect who is counted as being 
in poverty. The official poverty 
measure only considers pretax 
income and uses national 
thresholds that are inflation-
adjusted, allowing for consistent 
measurement of poverty over 
time. This allows us to measure 
poverty consistently going back 
to the 1960s. The downside of 
this approach is that it does 
not capture changes to tax and 
transfer programs that can affect 
family and household resources, 
nor does it account for geographic 
differences in cost-of-living. 

In contrast, the SPM accounts 
for income and payroll taxes, tax 
credits, noncash benefits, and 
nondiscretionary expenses. It uses 
geographically adjusted poverty 
thresholds that are updated by 
BLS with recent information on 
food, clothing, shelter, utility, tele-
phone, and internet expenditures. 
This results in a poverty measure 
that accounts for current stan-
dards of living as well as short-
term policy changes in response 
to current events that operate 
primarily as noncash benefits or 
through the tax system.

Together, the two measures 
provide useful information on 
economic well-being—historic 
and current—that is particularly 
informative during periods of rapid 
change.

ENDNOTES

1 The Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) determined the official definition of 
poverty in Statistical Poverty Directive 14. 
Appendix A provides more details on how 
the Census Bureau calculates official poverty 
and on the definition of money income.

2 Pretax money income refers to gross 
income received from a variety of sources 
like earnings, Social Security, pensions, 
and disability benefits. It does not include 
tax credits, like the Earned Income Tax 
Credit (EITC) or the Child Tax Credit, nor 
does it include noncash benefits, such as 
subsidized housing or nutritional assistance 
programs. More information on how income 
is measured in the official poverty measure is 
available in Appendix A.

4 Because unrelated individuals under 
the age of 15 are excluded from the official 
poverty universe, there were 550,400 fewer 
children in the official poverty universe 
than in the total civilian noninstitutionalized 
population and the SPM universe in 2023. 
More information on this difference is 
provided later in the report and in the 
SPM technical documentation available 
at <https://www2.census.gov/programs-

65 years and older were not statistically

6 In 2023, SPM rates were not statistically 
different for Black and American Indian and 
Alaska Native individuals, American Indian 
and Alaska Native and Hispanic individuals, 
and Asian individuals and those reporting 
Two or More Races.

7 Because the CPS ASEC does not ask 

income questions for individuals under 
the age of 15, unrelated individuals under 
15 are excluded from the official poverty 
universe. Official+ includes these individuals 
for a consistent universe with the SPM.

SPM technical documentation, available

8 Thresholds for the SPM are produced by 

the BLS Division of Price and Index Number 
Research. The 2022 and 2023 thresholds are 
in Table B-1.

9 Unrelated individuals are people of any 
age who are not living with any other family 
members. When calculating family poverty, 
these individuals are treated as single-person 
units.

10 The CPS ASEC is updated periodically 
to improve data quality. These improvements 
include changes to survey design, such as 
sampling and survey instrument changes; 
changes to data processing, such as 
weighting and data imputation methods; 
and changes to how the SPM is constructed. 
When feasible, the Census Bureau provides 
data users with resources that allow them to 
evaluate the impact of these survey changes 
across years. As a result, two estimates are 
provided for reference years 2013, 2017, and 
2019, which reflect years in which there were 
major changes to the survey and poverty 
measure methodology. Given these changes, 
historical comparisons should be made 
with caution. In this report, estimates are 
compared to published estimates for earlier 
years when the questionnaire and processing 
system changes did not result in statistically 
significant differences. When survey changes 
did have statistically significant effects on 
income or poverty estimates, comparisons 
are made by adjusting historical published 
estimates to approximate the magnitude of 
these effects. More details on the adjustment 
used for these comparisons are available at 
<www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/09/
us-median-household-income-not-
significantly-different-from-2017.html>.

11 Official poverty rates for 18- to 64-year-

olds and those 65 and older were not 
statistically different in 2023.

12 A family is a group of two or more 

people (not necessarily including the 
householder) related by birth, marriage, or 
adoption and residing together. A primary 
family includes the householder and 
members related by the same categories. 
All such people (including related subfamily 
members) are considered as members of 
one family. To assign thresholds and produce 
poverty estimates, unrelated individuals are 
treated as single-person units.

13 In the report text and figures, families 
with a female householder with no spouse 
present are be referred to as female-
householder families. Families with a male 
householder with no spouse present are 
referred to as male-householder families.

14 Federal surveys give respondents the 

option of reporting more than one race. 
Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race 
group are possible. A group, such as Asian, 
may be defined as those who reported 
Asian and no other race (the race-alone 
or single-race concept) or as those who 
reported Asian regardless of whether they 
also reported another race (the race-alone-
or-in-combination concept). The body of 
this report (text and figures) shows data 
using the first approach (race alone), along 
with estimates for Two or More Races. The 
appendix tables show data using both 
approaches. Primary use of the single-race 
population does not imply that it is the 
preferred method of presenting or analyzing 
data. The Census Bureau uses a variety of 
approaches. In this report, the terms “White, 
not Hispanic” and “non-Hispanic White” are 
used interchangeably and refer to people 
who are not Hispanic and who reported 
White and no other race. This report uses 

non-Hispanic White as the comparison 
group for other race and Hispanic origin 
groups. Since Hispanic individuals may be 
any race, data in this report for the Hispanic 
population overlap with data for race 
groups. Of those who reported only one 
race, Hispanic origin was reported by 17.1 
percent of White householders, 5.8 percent 
of Black householders, 2.4 percent of Asian 
householders, and 32.3 percent of American 
Indian and Alaska Native householders. 
Data users should exercise caution when 
interpreting aggregate results for the 
Hispanic population or for race groups 
because these populations consist of many 
distinct groups that differ in socioeconomic 
characteristics, culture, and nativity. Data on 
Hispanic origin were first collected in 1972. 
Data on Asian and Pacific Islander origin and 
American Indian and Alaska Native origin 
were first collected in 1987. More information 
is available at <www.census.gov/programs-
surveys/cps.html>.

15 Estimates for the Asian, American 
Indian and Alaska Native, and Two or More 
Races populations have large variances. This 
is a result of small sample sizes and the fact 
that the CPS ASEC does not use separate 
population controls for weighting these 
groups to national totals. The American 
Community Survey (ACS), based on a 
much larger sample of the population, is a 
better source for estimating and identifying 
changes for small subgroups of the 
population.

16 The percentage-point change between 
2022 and 2023 was not statistically different 
for White and non-Hispanic white individuals.
17 Official poverty rates for White and 

Asian individuals were not statistically 
different in 2023.

18 Official poverty rates for Black 
and Native American and Alaska Native 
individuals were not statistically different in 
2023.

19 The poverty-to-total-population ratios 

for Black and American Indian and Alaska 
Native individuals were not statistically 
different in 2023.

20 Information on educational attainment 

in the CPS ASEC is available at <www.
census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/technical-
documentation/subject-definitions.html>. 
Those with an associate degree are included 
in the “some college” category.

21 The percentage-point change between 
2022 and 2023 was not statistically different 
for males and females.

22 SPM rates for children and those 
65 years and older were not statistically 
different in 2023.

23 The year-to-year increase in the SPM 

thresholds was not statistically different 
between the three housing tenure groups.

24 In 2023, SPM rates were not statistically 

different for Black and American Indian and 
Alaska Native individuals, American Indian 
and Alaska Native and Hispanic individuals, 
and Asian individuals and those reporting 
Two or More Races.

25 Historical estimates are not shown 
separately for American Indian and Alaska 
Native or Two or More Races children due to 
small sample sizes with large variances. The 
ACS, based on a much larger sample of the 
population, is a better source for estimating 
and identifying changes for small subgroups 
of the population.

the SPM thresholds are based on the 5-year 
moving average of expenditures for a bundle 
of goods, lagged by a year.

base SPM thresholds were not statistically

the increase in the thresholds for owners 
without a mortgage (6.8 percent) was not 
statistically different from the increase in 
the official poverty measure thresholds (4.1 
percent).

31 SPM rates for children and those

18- to 64-year-olds and those 65 and older.

32 Table B-5 provides additional estimates 

of income-to-poverty ratios by race and 
ethnicity.

33 Child support payments received 
are counted as income in both the official 
poverty measure and the SPM. Child support 
paid is only deducted in the SPM.

34 Median weekly work expenses were 
$39.30 for 2023 using the 2023 SIPP. Medical 
expenses include contributions toward the 
cost of medical care and health insurance 
premiums.

Appendix A. Estimates of Official Poverty

HOW OFFICIAL POVERTY IS 
CALCULATED 

Following the Office of 
Management and Budget’s (OMB) 
Statistical Policy Directive 14, the 
U.S. Census Bureau uses a set of 
dollar value thresholds that vary 
by family size and composition to 
determine who is in poverty (avail-
able in the table below).

If a family’s total money income 
is less than the applicable thresh-
old, then that family and every 
individual in it are considered to 
be in poverty. The official poverty 
thresholds are updated annually for 
inflation using the Consumer Price 
Index for All Urban Consumers 
(CPI-U). The official poverty defini-
tion uses money income before 
taxes or tax credits and excludes 
capital gains and noncash benefits 
(such as Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program benefits and 
housing assistance). The thresholds 
do not vary geographically.

Example: Consider a five-person 
family with two children, their 
mother, their father, and their 

great-aunt. This family’s 2023 
poverty threshold is $37,275. Each 
family member had the following 
income in 2023:

Mother   
Father    
Great-aunt  
First child  
Second child  
Total:  

$14,000  
$13,500  
$11,000  
         $0  
         $0  
              $38,500 

Since their total family income 
($38,500) was higher than their 
threshold ($37,275), this fam-
ily would not be considered “in 
poverty.”

The OMB Statistical Policy Directive 
14 directed the Census Bureau to 
consistently update the poverty 
thresholds each year for cost of 
living changes. Thresholds in this 
report series are adjusted using the 
CPI-U and are compared to cur-
rent year (unadjusted for inflation) 
money income. If, alternatively, the 
Consumer Price Index Retroactive 
Series for all Urban Consumers All 
Items (R-CPI-U-RS) index had been 
used to inflation-adjust poverty 

thresholds from previous years, cur-
rent poverty rates would be lower. 
This is because the R-CPI-U-RS 
results in a smaller cost-of-living 
adjustment over longer periods 
than the CPI-U.

While the thresholds, in some 
sense, represent the needs of 
families, they should be interpreted 
as a statistical yardstick rather than 
as a complete description of what 
people and families need to live. 
There are other ways to measure a 
family’s needs; many government 
assistance programs use different 
income eligibility cutoffs, while the 
Supplemental Poverty Measure 
(SPM) uses a different approach 
for setting thresholds and defining 
resources. Additional information 
on SPM methodology is available in 
the SPM technical documentation 
at <https://www2.census.gov/
programs-surveys/supplemental-
poverty-measure/datasets/spm/
spm_techdoc.pdf>.

Weighted Average Thresholds

Since some data users want a sum-
mary of the 48 thresholds to get 
a general sense of the “poverty 
line,” the following table provides 
the weighted average thresholds 
for 2023. The weighted average 
thresholds are based on the relative 
number of unrelated individuals 
and primary families of each size 
and composition and are not used 
in computing poverty estimates.1

HOW INCOME IS MEASURED

A family’s money income is used 
to determine the poverty status 
of the family and all individuals in 
it. Money income is calculated for 
each person 15 years and older 
in the Current Population Survey 
Annual Social and Economic 
Supplement (CPS ASEC) sample. 
Respondents are asked questions 
on the amount of money income 
received in the preceding calendar 

year from each of the following 
sources:

1.  Earnings.

2.  Unemployment compensation.

3.  Workers’ compensation.

4.  Social Security.

5.  Supplemental Security Income.

6.  Public assistance.

7.  Veterans’ payments.

8.  Survivor benefits.

9.  Disability benefits.

10. Pension or retirement income.

11. Interest.

12. Dividends.

13. Rents, royalties, and estates 

and trusts.

14. Educational assistance.

15. Alimony.

16. Child support.

17. Financial assistance from 
outside the household.

18. Other income. 

Data on income collected in the 
CPS ASEC cover money income 
received (exclusive of certain 
money receipts such as capital 
gains) before payments for per-
sonal income taxes, Social Security, 
union dues, Medicare deductions, 
etc. Money income also excludes 
tax credits such as the Earned 
Income Tax Credit and the Child 
Tax Credit. Money income does not 
reflect that some families receive 
noncash benefits such as nutri-
tional assistance programs, health 
benefits, and subsidized housing. 
In addition, money income does 
not reflect the fact that noncash 
benefits often take the form of the 
use of business transportation and 
facilities, full or partial payments by 
businesses for retirement programs, 
medical and educational expenses, 
etc.

The income of the household does 
not include amounts received by 
people who were members dur-
ing all or part of the previous year 

if these people no longer resided 
in the household at the time of the 
interview. However, the CPS ASEC 
includes income data for people 
who are current residents but did 
not reside in the household dur-
ing the previous year. It should be 
noted that although the income 
statistics refer to receipts during 
the preceding calendar year, the 
demographic characteristics such 
as age, labor force status, and 
household composition are as of 
the survey date.

Data users should consider these 
elements when comparing income 
levels. Moreover, readers should 
be aware that for many different 
reasons, many respondents tend 
to misreport or not report all types 
of income.2 Income earned from 
wages or salaries, the largest com-
ponent of money income, tends to 
be more accurately reported and 
weighted totals are in line with 
other aggregate benchmarks.3 
Still, estimates in this report are 
affected by ongoing challenges 
of nonresponse and misreport-
ing. More details on the impact of 
nonresponse bias are available in 
Appendix C.

ENDNOTES

1 A primary family is a group of two 

or more people, one of whom is the 
householder, related by birth, marriage, 
or adoption and residing together. All 
such people (including related subfamily 
members) are considered members of one 
family.

and nature of nonresponse and misreporting,

* An asterisk preceding an estimate indicates change is statistically different from zero at the 90 percent confidence level.
Z Rounds to zero.
¹ A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to and

² Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are possible. A group, such as Asian, may be defined as 
those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-
in-combination concept). This table shows estimates for the race-alone population and the Two or More Races population. The primary use of the single-race population does not imply that it 
is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The Census Bureau presents data on race in a variety of ways. Estimates for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders are not shown 
separately due to sample size.

³ Information on metropolitan statistical areas and principal cities is available at <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/about/glossary.html>.
⁴ The sum of those with and without a disability does not equal the total because disability status is not defined for individuals in the U.S. armed forces.
Note: Details may not sum to totals due to rounding. Estimates may differ from previous publications due to additional rounding implemented to protect respondent privacy.

* An asterisk preceding an estimate indicates change is statistically different from zero at the 90 percent confidence level.
¹ A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to and 

subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. MOEs shown in this table are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights.

² A primary family is a group of two or more people, one of whom is the householder, related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. All such people (including related sub-

family members) are considered as members of one family.

³ An unrelated subfamily is defined as a married couple with or without children or a single parent with one or more own, never-married children under the age of 18 living in a household 

and not related by birth, marriage, or adoption to the householder.

⁴ Unrelated individuals are people of any age who are not living with any other family members.
Note: Details may not sum to totals due to rounding. Estimates may differ from previous publications due to additional rounding implemented to protect respondent privacy.

¹ Since 2003, federal surveys have allowed respondents to report more than one race. Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are 

possible. A group, such as Asian, may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as 
those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows 
data using both approaches. Since Hispanic individuals may be any race, data for the Hispanic population overlap with data for race groups. Of 
those who reported only one race in the 2024 CPS ASEC, Hispanic origin was reported by 17.1 percent of White householders, 5.8 percent of 
Black householders, 2.4 percent of Asian householders, and 32.3 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native householders. Data users should 
exercise caution when interpreting aggregate results for the Hispanic population or for race groups because these populations consist of many 
distinct groups that differ in socioeconomic characteristics, culture, and nativity. Data on Hispanic origin was first collected in 1972. Data on 
Asian and Pacific Islander origin and American Indian and Alaska Native origin was first collected in 1987. Estimates for Native Hawaiians and 
Other Pacific Islanders are not shown separately due to sample size.
² Implementation of 2020 Census-based population controls.
³ Estimates reflect the implementation of an updated processing system and should be used to make comparisons to 2018 and subsequent 

years.

⁴ The 2014 CPS ASEC included redesigned questions for income and health insurance coverage. All of the approximately 98,000 addresses 
were eligible to receive the redesigned set of health insurance coverage questions. The redesigned income questions were implemented to a sub-
sample of these 98,000 addresses using a probability split panel design. Approximately 68,000 addresses were eligible to receive a set of income 
questions similar to those used in the 2013 CPS ASEC and the remaining 30,000 addresses were eligible to receive the redesigned income ques-
tions. The source of these 2013 estimates is the portion of the CPS ASEC sample that received the redesigned income questions, approximately 
30,000 addresses.

⁵ The source of these 2013 estimates is the portion of the CPS ASEC sample that received the income questions consistent with the 2013 CPS 

ASEC, approximately 68,000 addresses.

⁶ Implementation of 2010 Census-based population controls.
⁷ Data have been revised to reflect a correction to the weights in the 2005 CPS ASEC.
⁸ Implementation of a 28,000-household sample expansion.
⁹ Implementation of 2000 Census-based population controls.
10 Full implementation of 1990 Census-based sample design and metropolitan definitions, 7,000-household sample reduction, and revised 

editing of responses on race.

11 Introduction of 1990 Census-based sample design.
12 Data collection method changed from paper and pencil to computer-assisted interviewing. In addition, the 1994 CPS ASEC was revised to 
allow for the coding of different income amounts on selected questionnaire items. Limits either increased or decreased in the following catego-
ries: earnings limits increased to $999,999; Social Security limits increased to $49,999; Supplemental Security Income and public assistance limits 
increased to $24,999; veterans’ benefits limits increased to $99,999; child support and alimony limits decreased to $49,999.

13 Implementation of 1990 Census-based population controls.
14 Estimates are revised to correct for nine omitted weights from the original 1992 CPS ASEC. More information is available in “Money Income 

of Households, Families, and Persons in the United States: 1992,” P60-184.

15 Estimates reflect the implementation of a new CPS ASEC processing system and are also revised to reflect corrections to the files after 

publication of the 1988 advance report “Money Income and Poverty Status in the United States: 1988,” P60-166.

16 Full implementation of 1980 Census-based sample design.
17 Implementation of Hispanic population weighting controls and introduction of 1980 Census-based sample design.
18 Implemented three technical changes to the poverty definition. More information is available in “Characteristics of the Population Below the 

Poverty Level: 1980,” P60-133.

19 Implementation of 1980 Census-based population controls. Questionnaire expanded to show 27 possible values from 51 possible sources of 

income.

20 Implementation of a new CPS ASEC processing system. Questionnaire expanded to ask 11 income questions.
21 Full implementation of 1970 Census-based sample design.
22 Introduction of 1970 Census-based sample design and population controls.
23 Implementation of a new CPS ASEC processing system.
Note: Details may not sum to totals due to rounding. Estimates may differ from previous publications due to additional rounding implemented 

to protect respondent privacy.

U.S. Census Bureau 

Appendix B. The Supplemental Poverty Measure

The Supplemental Poverty 
Measure (SPM) was developed 
following decades of research on 
poverty measurement. Details 
regarding the history of the SPM 
and the current methodology can 
be found in the SPM technical 
documentation at <https://www2.
census.gov/programs-surveys/
supplemental-poverty-measure/
datasets/spm/spm_techdoc.pdf>.

UPDATES FOR 2023

Updates to Resources

Tax Model

SPM estimates for 2023 reflect 
minor changes to federal, state, 
and local (for select states) income 
taxes. Most changes were related 
to the expiration of state tax credit 
rebates enacted in 2022. Most 
expired, but four states extended 
or added state tax credit rebates 
in 2023. Additionally, more than 
10 states added or expanded their 
state earned income tax credit, 
child tax credit, and/or child and 
dependent care credit programs.

Details on the tax model 
methodology and more 
information on changes for 2023 
can be found at <www.census.
gov/topics/income-poverty/
income/guidance/tax-model.
html>. 

School Lunch Methodology

The methodology for estimating 
the value of school lunches 
provided by the National School 
Lunch Program varied from 

2020 to 2022 to account for the 
COVID-19 pandemic.1 With the 
end of pandemic flexibilities, the 
methodology for estimating school 
lunch values has stabilized; the 
2023 values were estimated using 
2023 reimbursement rates and the 
same methodology as was used 
for fall 2022. This methodology 
accounts for states that provide 
universal free school lunches 
and for the Pandemic Electronic 
Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) program, 
which ended after summer 
2023.2 In states with universal 
free lunches, those who reported 
receiving free or reduced price 
lunches were assigned the free 
lunch value for the year.3 Those 
who reported paying for lunch 
were assigned the paid lunch 
value regardless of whether the 
state provides universal free 
lunches. As in previous years, 
the P-EBT benefits were only 
included in the school lunch 
value when respondents reported 
P-EBT receipt but did not receive 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program (SNAP) benefits. This is 
done to avoid double-counting 
P-EBT benefits. 

Updates to Thresholds

The 2023 poverty thresholds were 
updated to include broadband 
subsidies. Otherwise, the 
construction of the thresholds is 
unchanged from 2022. Details on 
the methodology and research on 
the SPM thresholds are available 
at <https://stats.bls.gov/pir/
spmhome.htm>.

Evaluation and Improvements to 
the SPM 

In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau 
commissioned the National 
Academies’ Committee on 
National Statistics (CNSTAT) to 
convene a panel to evaluate the 
SPM and offer recommendations 
to improve the measure in the 
future. The expert panel produced 
a consensus report in April 2023 
that outlined key areas of research 
for the Census Bureau and the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 
to work on in the coming years. 
The panel’s report can be found at 
<https://nap.nationalacademies.
org/catalog/26825/an-updated-
measure-of-poverty-redrawing-
the-line>. 

The Census Bureau conducts 
ongoing research on 
improvements and will consider 
the recommendations of the 
CNSTAT panel alongside research 
by external and governmental 
experts in developing a research 
agenda and roadmap for 
improvements to the SPM. In 
considering any changes that 
would be made to the SPM, the 
Census Bureau will continue to 
work with BLS and the current 
Interagency Technical Working 
Group (ITWG) on the SPM, which 
was established in 2016. The ITWG 
on the SPM has an established 
process for making changes to 
the SPM, with major changes 
occurring only after a multiyear 
process of research and public 
engagement.

the 2021 methodology is at <www.census.

2 The 2023 summer P-EBT benefit was 

$120 per child. 

3 Six states offered universal free lunches 

in the 2022–2023 school year: California, 
Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, 
and Vermont. Four additional states—
Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, and New 
Mexico—began to offer universal free 
meals in the 2023–2024 school year. The 
methodology assumes that the four states 
that offered universal free meals beginning 
in the 2023–2024 school year had universal 
free meals for the whole year.

Interagency Technical Working 
Group Statement of Duties

The ITWG on the SPM meets 
quarterly to review major and 
minor methodological changes 
to the SPM. The ITWG ensures 
that the SPM captures year-to-
year changes in governmental 
policy and discusses potential 
measurement improvements. 
The ITWG will continue to advise 
the Census Bureau and BLS on 
potential changes and updates to 
the SPM methodology.

Source: The 2023 Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) thresholds were produced by Ryan M. Unitan in the Division of Price and Index 
Number Research, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The thresholds and standard errors are based on data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure 
Survey (CE) Interview, with all data consumer unit weighted. Standard errors of the thresholds are derived using replicate weights available in 
the CE Inteview data files. Information regarding the estimation of standard errors based on CE replicate weights is available at <www.bls.gov/
cex/pumd-getting-started-guide.htm>. Thresholds and standard errors are produced as a BLS research series and are not considered an official 
production series. Methodological details and related research regarding the SPM thresholds are available at <https://stats.bls.gov/pir/spmhome.
htm>. The 2023 thresholds and related statistics were finalized as of May 13, 2024, and include the imputed value of broadband subsidy benefits. 
The thresholds for 2022 were finalized as of May 11, 2023.

defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the 
race-alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows data using both approaches. Since Hispanic individuals may be any race, data for the Hispanic population overlap with data for race 
groups. Of those who reported only one race in the 2024 CPS ASEC, Hispanic origin was reported by 17.1 percent of White householders, 5.8 percent of Black householders, 2.4 percent of 
Asian householders, and 32.3 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native householders. Data users should exercise caution when interpreting aggregate results for the Hispanic population 
or for race groups because these populations consist of many distinct groups that differ in socioeconomic characteristics, culture, and nativity. Data on Hispanic origin were first collected in 
1972. Data on Asian and Pacific Islander origin and American Indian and Alaska Native origin were first collected in 1987. Estimates for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders are not 
shown separately due to sample size.

2 A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to and 

subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. MOEs shown in this table are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights.

3 Implementation of 2020 Census-based population controls.
4 Estimates reflect the implementation of revised Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) methodology. More information is provided in the SPM technical documentation available at
<https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/supplemental-poverty-measure/datasets/spm/spm_techdoc.pdf>.
⁵ Estimates reflect the implementation of an updated processing system and should be used to make comparisons to 2018 and subsequent years.
⁶ The 2014 CPS ASEC included redesigned questions for income and health insurance coverage. All of the approximately 98,000 addresses were eligible to receive the redesigned set of 

health insurance coverage questions. The redesigned income questions were implemented to a subsample of these 98,000 addresses using a probability split panel design. Approximately 
68,000 addresses were eligible to receive a set of income questions similar to those used in the 2013 CPS ASEC and the remaining 30,000 addresses were eligible to receive the redesigned 
income questions. The source of these 2013 estimates is the portion of the CPS ASEC sample that received the redesigned income questions, approximately 30,000 addresses.

⁷ The source of these 2013 estimates is the portion of the CPS ASEC sample that received the income questions consistent with the 2013 CPS ASEC, approximately 68,000 addresses.
⁸ Implementation of 2010 Census-based population controls.
Note: Details may not sum to rounding. Estimates may differ from previous publications due to additional rounding implemented to protect respondent privacy.

Z Rounds to zero.
* An asterisk preceding an estimate indicates change is statistically different from zero at the 90 percent confidence level.
¹ A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable 

the estimate. This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. MOEs shown in this table 
are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights.

² Unrelated individuals are people of any age who are not living with any other family members. 
³ Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are 
possible. A group, such as Asian, may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as 
those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows 
estimates for the race-alone population and the Two or More Races population. The primary use of the single-race population does not imply that 
it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The Census Bureau presents data on race in a variety of ways. Estimates for Native 
Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders are not shown separately due to sample size.

⁴ Information on metropolitan statistical areas and principal cities is available at <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/about/

glossary.html>.

5 The sum of those with and without a disability does not equal the total because disability status is not defined for individuals in the  

U.S. armed forces.

Note: SPM is the Supplemental Poverty Measure. Details may not sum to totals due to rounding. Estimates may differ from previous 

publications due to additional rounding implemented to protect respondent privacy.

* An asterisk preceding an estimate indicates change is statistically different from zero at the 90 percent confidence level.
¹ A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable 

the estimate. This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. MOEs shown in this table 
are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights.

² Unrelated individuals are people of any age who are not living with any other family members. 
³ Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are 
possible. A group, such as Asian, may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as 
those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows 
estimates for the race-alone population and the Two or More Races population. The primary use of the single-race population does not imply that 
it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The Census Bureau presents data on race in a variety of ways. Estimates for Native 
Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders are not shown separately due to sample size.

⁴ Information on metropolitan statistical areas and principal cities is available at <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/about/

glossary.html>.

5 The sum of those with and without a disability does not equal the total because disability status is not defined for individuals in the  

U.S. armed forces.

Note: Official+ includes unrelated individuals under the age of 15. SPM is the Supplemental Poverty Measure. Details may not sum to totals due 

to rounding.

¹ A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable 

the estimate. This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. MOEs shown in this table 
are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights.

² Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are 
possible. A group, such as Asian, may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as 
those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows 
estimates for the race-alone population and the Two or More Races population. The primary use of the single-race population does not imply that 
it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The Census Bureau presents data on race in a variety of ways. Estimates for Native 
Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders are not shown separately due to sample size.

Note: Official+ includes unrelated individuals under the age of 15. SPM is the Supplemental Poverty Measure. Details may not sum to totals due 

to rounding. Estimates may differ from previous publications due to additional rounding implemented to protect respondent privacy.

Z Rounds to zero.
¹ A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable 

the estimate. This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. MOEs shown in this table 
are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights.

² Refundable tax credits include the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the refundable portion of the Child Tax Credit.
³ SNAP is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; SSI is Supplemental Security Income; TANF is Temporary Assistance for Needy 
Families; WIC is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children; FICA is the Federal Insurance Contributions Act.

⁴ Utility assistance includes the Affordable Connectivity Program and other noncash energy benefits.
Note: Details may not sum to totals due to rounding. Estimates may differ from previous publications due to additional rounding implemented 

to protect respondent privacy.

U.S. Census Bureau 

Appendix C. Additional Information

SOURCE AND ACCURACY OF 
THE ESTIMATES

The Current Population Survey 
(CPS) is the longest-running 
survey conducted by the  
U.S. Census Bureau. The CPS is a 
household survey primarily used 
to collect employment data. The 
sample universe for the basic CPS 
consists of the resident civilian 
noninstitutionalized population 
of the United States. People in 
institutions, such as prisons, long-
term care hospitals, and nursing 
homes, are not eligible to be 
interviewed in the CPS. Students 
living in dormitories are included 
in the estimates only if information 
about them is reported in an 
interview at their parents’ home. 
Since the CPS is a household 
survey, people who are homeless 
and not living in shelters are not 
included in the sample.

The CPS Annual Social and 
Economic Supplement (CPS 
ASEC), the source for the 
estimates in this report, collects 
data in February, March, and 
April each year, asking detailed 
questions categorizing income into 
over 50 sources. The key purpose 
of the survey is to provide timely 
and comprehensive estimates 
of income, poverty, and health 
insurance and to measure change 
in these national-level estimates. 
The survey is the official source 
of national poverty estimates 
calculated in accordance with 
the Office of Management 
and Budget’s Statistical Policy 
Directive 14 (Appendix A).

The CPS ASEC collects data in 
the 50 states and the District 
of Columbia; these data do not 

represent residents of Puerto 
Rico or the U.S. Island Areas.1 The 
2024 CPS ASEC sample consists 
of about 89,500 addresses. The 
CPS ASEC includes military 
personnel who live in a household 
with at least one civilian adult, 
regardless of whether they live 
on- or off-post. All other armed 
forces personnel are excluded. 
The estimates in this report 
are controlled to March 2024 
independent national population 
estimates by age, sex, race, and 
Hispanic origin. Beginning with 
the data for 2020, population 
estimates are based on 2020 
Census population counts and are 
updated annually after accounting 
for births, deaths, emigration, and 
immigration.

The estimates in this report (which 
may be shown in text, figures, and 
tables) are based on responses 
from a sample of the population 
and may differ from actual values 
because of sampling variability 
or other factors. As a result, 
apparent differences between the 
estimates for two or more groups 
may not be statistically significant. 
All comparative statements have 
undergone statistical testing and 
are statistically significant at the 
90 percent confidence level unless 
otherwise noted.

In this report, the variances of 
estimates were calculated using 
replication methods. For estimates 
prior to 2010, or as noted in 
historical tables, the Generalized 
Variance Function (GVF) method 
was used. More information on 
replicate weights, standard errors, 
income top-coding and data 
swapping on the public-use file, 

and changes to the CPS ASEC 
data file from the prior year is 
available at <https://www2.
census.gov/programs-surveys/
cps/techdocs/cpsmar24.pdf>.

Nonresponse Bias in the CPS 
ASEC

The Census Bureau administers 
the CPS ASEC each year between 
February and April by telephone 
and in-person interviews, with 
most data collected in March. In 
2020, normal data collection was 
interrupted due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. The response rate fell 
to 73 percent in March 2020, down 
from 82 percent in March 2019. 
Response rates were regularly 
above 80 percent before the 
pandemic. 

Although standard collection 
procedures have resumed, 
response rates remain lower than 
they were before the pandemic. 
The response rate for the CPS 
basic household survey was 67 
percent in March 2024. Lower 
response rates could affect 
estimates if respondents differ 
from nonrespondents. More 
information on how sample 
differences and nonresponse 
bias affected income and 
poverty estimates in the 2024 
CPS ASEC is available at <www.
census.gov/newsroom/blogs/
research-matters/2024/09/
administrative-data-nonresponse-
bias-cps-asec.html>. Information 
on how data collection issues in 
2020 affected health insurance 
coverage estimates is available 
at <www.census.gov/library/
working-papers/2020/demo/

CPS ASEC Modernization

The Census Bureau has begun 
a multiyear effort to modernize 
many of its surveys, including the 
CPS. Part of this involves adding 
an Internet Self-Response (ISR) 
mode to the CPS and then the CPS 
ASEC. 

This project requires extensive 
review and testing to ensure 
that ISR is a viable collection 
mode for the CPS ASEC and that 
changes do not negatively affect 
the reliability and comparability 
of the estimates. The project 
schedule seeks to align the CPS 
ASEC modernization effort with 
that of the CPS to maintain 
continuity. However, the schedule 
and activities may change to 
accommodate funding availability, 
discovery of issues during 
testing and analysis, and project 
reprioritization.

For more information about the 
ASEC modernization project and 
timeline, visit the Census Bureau’s 
CPS ASEC Modernization Efforts 
webpage at <www.census.gov/
programs-surveys/cps/about/
modernization/asecmodernization.

National Experimental Well-Being 
Statistics (NEWS) Project

The NEWS project is an 
experimental effort to develop 
improved estimates of income, 
poverty, and other measures of 
economic well-being by using all 
available survey, administrative, 
and commercial data.

The first NEWS release in 
February 2023 included a working 
paper that provided improved 
estimates of income and official 
poverty statistics for 2018.

three possible sources of bias 
documented in prior research 
by improving weights to correct 
for unit nonresponse, improving 
imputation to correct for missing 
information in survey and 
administrative data, and combining 
or replacing survey responses with 
administrative data to correct for 
misreporting. 

Reducing survey error using these 
techniques substantially affected 
key measures of well-being. Using 
these experimental methods, 
median household income was 
estimated to be 6.3 percent 
higher than in survey estimates, 
while the official poverty rate 
was 1.1 percentage points lower. 
These differences were driven 
by subpopulations that were 
disproportionately affected by 
survey error, like householders 65 
years and older. For this group, 
median household income was 
27.3 percent higher than in survey 
estimates, while the official 
poverty rate was 3.3 percentage 
points lower. 

The NEWS project plans to release 
additional years of statistics, 
produce more timely estimates, 
and measure additional income 
concepts. 

BUSINESS CYCLES—
RECESSIONS

Business cycle peaks and troughs 
used to delineate the beginning 
and end of recessions, as shown 
in the text box “Business Cycles—
Recessions,” are determined by 
the National Bureau of Economic 
Research (NBER), a private 
research organization. The data 
points in the time-series figures 
in this report use July as a 
reference. According to the NBER 
chronology, the most recent peak 
occurred in February 2020. The 
most recent trough occurred in 
April 2020. More information on 
business cycle dating is available 
at <www.nber.org/research/
business-cycle-dating>.

ACCESSING POVERTY DATA

Additional CPS ASEC Estimates

Additional estimates from the CPS 
ASEC are available on the Census 
Bureau’s poverty websites. This 
includes detailed and historical 
tables, press releases, briefings, 
and working papers. The websites 
may be accessed through the 
Census Bureau’s homepage at 
<www.census.gov> or directly 
at <www.census.gov/topics/
income-poverty/poverty.html> and 
<www.census.gov/topics/income-
poverty/supplemental-poverty-
measure.html>.

Public-Use Microdata

Public-use CPS ASEC microdata is 
available for data users of all skill 
levels.

Data users can create custom 
statistics from public-use 
microdata files using the Microdata 
Access Tool (MDAT) available at 
<https://data.census.gov/mdat>.

Microdata for the 2024 CPS ASEC 
and earlier years are available 
online at <www.census.gov/data/
datasets/time-series/demo/
cps/cps-asec.html>. Technical 
methods have been applied to 
CPS microdata to avoid disclosing 
respondents’ identities.

The Census Data Application 
Programming Interface (API) gives 
the public access to raw statistical 
data from various Census Bureau 
data programs. It is an efficient 
way to query data directly from 
Census Bureau servers. The 
historical poverty data found in 
Table HSTPOV2 are available in the 
API at <www.census.gov/data/
developers/data-sets/Poverty-
Statistics.html>.2 The table is also 
available at <https://data.census.

of geography and for smaller 
population groups.

Starting in January 2023, the 
monthly CPS began implementing 
changes to provide additional 
confidentiality protection to the 
data. As part of these changes, 
geographies with populations 
between 100,000 and 249,000 are 
partially synthesized for privacy 
protection. Refer to <https://
www2.census.gov/programs-
surveys/cps/methodology/
improving-disclosure-avoidance-
puf-v2.pdf> for more details. This 
synthesis only affects the public 
use file. More information on 
the effect of these changes on 
SPM estimates generated from 
the public-use file can be found 
at <www.census.gov/library/
working-papers/2023/demo/
SEHSD-WP2023-25.html>.

OTHER SOURCES OF 
POVERTY DATA

The Census Bureau recommends 
that people use the CPS ASEC for 
timely and thorough estimates 
of national poverty. However, the 
Census Bureau produces other 
data that are appropriate for 
subnational areas and longitudinal 
analysis. The American Community 
Survey (ACS) and the Small Area 
Income and Poverty Estimates 
(SAIPE) program can be used for 
subnational poverty estimates, 
while the Survey of Income and 
Program Participation (SIPP) 
provides monthly and longitudinal 
estimates.

American Community Survey

The ACS is an ongoing survey 
that collects comprehensive 
information on social, economic, 
and housing topics. Due to 
its large sample size, the ACS 
provides estimates at many levels 

The Census Bureau presents 
annual estimates of poverty by 
state and other smaller geographic 
units based on data collected in 
the ACS. Single-year estimates 
from the ACS are available for 
geographic units with populations 
of 65,000 or more. Estimates 
of income and poverty for all 
geographic units, including census 
tracts and block groups, are 
available by pooling 5 years of ACS 
data. Poverty estimates from the 
ACS are available at <https://data.
census.gov/>.

Small Area Income and Poverty 
Estimates

The SAIPE program uses statistical 
models to produce estimates of 
median household income and 
poverty for states and all counties, 
as well as population and poverty 
estimates for school districts.

Statistics from the SAIPE program 
are used by the U.S. Department 
of Education to allocate funding 
under Title 1 of the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act. 
SAIPE methodology combines 
data from a variety of sources, 
including administrative records, 
population estimates, the 
decennial census, and the ACS 
to provide consistent and reliable 
single-year estimates for all 
counties and school districts, 
regardless of size, each year. 
In general, SAIPE estimates 
have lower variances than 
ACS estimates but offer fewer 
demographic details than the ACS. 
Estimates from this program are 
available at <www.census.gov/
programs-surveys/saipe.html>.

Survey of Income and Program 
Participation

The SIPP provides both monthly 
and longitudinal data about labor 
force participation and income 
sources and amounts at the 
individual, family, and household 
levels by following the same 
respondents over time. Whereas 
the CPS ASEC provides reliable 
estimates of the net change 
from one year to the next in the 
overall distribution of economic 
characteristics for the whole 
population, it cannot show how 
these characteristics change 
for the same person, family, or 
household. By collecting monthly 
data for the same respondents 
over multiple years, the SIPP 
makes it possible to observe 
how economic characteristics 

change at the individual level. This 
yields insights into the dynamic 
nature of these experiences, as 
well as the economic mobility of 
U.S. residents. Estimates from 
these data are available in table 
packages, working papers, and 
the Census Bureau’s P70 series 
reports, all available at <www.
census.gov/programs-surveys/
sipp/library/publications.html>.
