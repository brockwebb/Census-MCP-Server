Using the American
Community Survey
Summary File: What Data
Users Need to Know

October 2023

The American Community Survey
(ACS) Table-Based Summary File is

less complex and improves ease of
use. This format groups estimates

and margins of error into one file by
table ID for all Detailed Tables and all
geographies available. Data users
with programming skills and access
to statistical software can use the

Summary File to download and
analyze ACS data for a wide range of
geographic areas.

This guide provides an overview of
the ACS Table-Based Summary File
and how it can be used to access

data on America’s communities.
Data users using the original
Sequence-Based Summary File
format can find this documentation
and handbook on the ACS Summary
