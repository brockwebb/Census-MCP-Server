When comparing ACS estimates with other ACS estimates, there are several points to consider:

Change in geographic boundaries - The geographic boundaries for the 2023 ACS 1-year estimates represent the boundaries as
of January 1, 2023. Data users should be aware of changes in geographic boundaries when making comparisons. To learn
more about geographic boundaries and notable changes for 2023, check out the Geography Boundaries by Year [/programs-
surveys/acs/geography-acs/geography-boundaries-by-year.html]  and Geography Changes [/programs-surveys/acs/technical-
documentation/table-and-geography-changes/2023/geography-changes.html] webpages, respectively. For more information on
geographic concepts used in the ACS, visit Geography and the ACS [/programs-surveys/acs/geography-acs.html] .

Change in the questionnaire or coding - The list below provides details by subject for major questionnaire or coding changes.

Use Caution. The population continually ages—people enter into older age groups while babies fill the youngest
age group. This means that a completely different set of people make up each age group from one time period to
the next. Since populations occasionally experience booms/increases (for example, the postwar Baby Boom from
1946-1964) and busts/decreases in births, deaths, or migration, one should not necessarily expect that the
population in an age group in the 2010 Census should be similar in size or proportion to the population in the
same age group in different data year(s). For example, Baby Boomers were ages 46 to 64 in the 2010 Census
while they were ages 59 to 77 in the 2023 1-year ACS, and ages 55 to 77 in the 2019-2023 5-year period. So,
because Baby Boomers continue to age over time, the age groups 65 to 69 and 70 to 74 would show considerable
increase in population when comparing 2010 Census data with subsequent single year or multiyear ACS data.

should not compare 2023 1-year and 2022 1-year estimates of detailed mover categories. For other states and

Comparing 2019-2023 ACS 5-Year Estimates

Specifically, when comparing the 2019-2023 ACS 5-year estimates with other non-overlapping ACS 5-year estimates,

there are several points to consider:

Changes to the population controls – The 2019-2023 ACS 5-year estimates use population controls that are informed by the
2020 Census. For guidance regarding the population controls for this data release, refer to Population Controls for the 2023
ACS [/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2024-02.html] . For more information about how the
population estimates are used as controls for the ACS, visit the 2019-2023 ACS Multiyear Accuracy of the Data [/programs-
surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists/2023.html] document.

Data users should use caution when comparing ACS 5-year estimates that include 2020 with other ACS 5-year data.

There are multiple challenges to interpreting comparisons, including:

Changes to the weighting methodology implemented to address the nonresponse bias issues in the 2020 data, see
Modification to the 5-Year Estimation Methodology Containing Data Collected in 2020 [/programs-surveys/acs/technical-
documentation/user-notes/2022-03.html] .

Actual changes within the population and our ability to capture those changes.

-Estimates in the 2019-2023 ACS 5-year data set are inflation-adjusted to 2023 dollars.

The Census Bureau uses the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Consumer Price Index Retroactive Series (R-CPI-U-

[https://www.bls.gov/cpi/notices/2019/renaming-data-series.htm] ) to adjust for inflation. The annual average R-

CPI-U-RS for 2023 (449.3) is divided by the same for 2018 (369.1) to determine the multiplier to inflation-adjust

2018 dollars to 2023 dollars. Accordingly, dollar value estimates from the 2014-2018 file should be multiplied by

1.21728529 to convert 2018 dollars to 2023 dollars. The exception is the Comparative Economic Characteristics

2018 revision of the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). Occupation data for the years 2014 to 2018 was

coded based on the 2010 revision of the SOC. There were significant changes to the Census occupation codes as

a result of the 2018 SOC revisions. Therefore, the 2014-2018 and 2019-2023 occupation data are not comparable.
For more information on the Census occupation code changes, please visit the Industry and Occupation website

Use caution. Beginning in 2019 the telephone service question was revised in its structure and wording as a result
of findings from the 2016 ACS Content Test. For more information on this change, see the following ACS User

Note [/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2020-04.html] . In general, these changes led

to an increase in households with telephone service in the 2019-2023 period compared to the 2014-2018 period.

Value of Property
2019-2023 ACS 5-Year with 2014-2018 ACS 5-Year

Use caution. Beginning in 2022, reported home value collected on the American Community Survey (ACS) were

presented in current year dollars. This adjustment used the Retroactive Consumer Price Index Research Series (R-
CPI-U-RS), formerly known as the CPI-U-RS, which is used to adjust all other dollar-denominated estimates in the

ACS. This change brings the home value data in line with how all other dollar-denominated housing and income

items are adjusted to real (i.e., constant) dollars. For more information, see the ACS Home Value User Note
