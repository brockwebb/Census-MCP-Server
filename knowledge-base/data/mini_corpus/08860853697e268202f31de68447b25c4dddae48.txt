Wealth is an important indicator of economic well-being that provides valuable insights into a household’s economic

health. For example, during financial hardships, such as unemployment, illness, or divorce, wealth is a source of

liquidity to pay expenses and bills. This brief uses the 2023 Survey of Income and Program Participation to examine

household wealth in 2022.
