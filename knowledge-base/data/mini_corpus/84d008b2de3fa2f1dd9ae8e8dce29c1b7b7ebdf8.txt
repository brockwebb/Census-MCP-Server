INTRODUCTION

A population’s composition and distribution are 
directly affected by geographic mobility, sometimes 
referred to as migration. Geographic mobility is the 
movement of people from one place to another. Rates 
of geographic mobility vary by key demographic, 
socioeconomic, and temporal factors. Importantly, 
changes in geographic mobility do not happen uni-
formly across all population groups.1, 2 

A large and growing body of research tells us that age, 
calendar year, and birth cohort play essential roles in 
understanding a population at any one point in time.3 
Of particular interest is the birth cohort—groups of 
people who were born in the same timeframe. These 
people pass through life together and experience 
key historical events at similar ages. Birth cohorts are 
often informally referred to as “generations.”

This brief uses American Community Survey (ACS) 
1-year data from 2005 to 2023 and examines all 
people 1 year or older and who were born after the 
year 1927. ACS respondents from these data years are 
assigned to one of six commonly recognized birth

1945). 

•  The Baby Boomer Generation (birth years from 

1946 to 1964).

•  Generation X (birth years from 1965 to 1980).

•  The Millennial Generation (birth years from 1981 to 

1996).

•  Generation Z (birth years from 1997 to 2012).

•  Generation Alpha (birth years from 2013 onward).

Because each birth cohort has a nonoverlapping 
birth year range, each cohort occupies a unique age 
range in any given year.8 In 2005, only those in the 
Silent Generation were of retirement age (65 years 
and older). By 2011, the oldest of the Baby Boomers

geographic areas with populations of 65,000 and greater. For

5 The COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges to collecting ACS 

data in 2020 and, as a result, the ACS experienced high rates of 
nonresponse. To address these concerns, the Census Bureau released 
“experimental” estimates for the 2020 ACS 1-year data. For this 
reason, 2020 ACS 1-year estimates are not included in these analyses.

7 The U.S. Census Bureau does not have official definitions for 
these birth cohorts. The birth year ranges for each birth cohort may 
vary slightly across Census Bureau products. The use of these catego-
ries does not imply that this is the preferred method of presenting or 
analyzing data.

were of retirement age. Inversely, 
the Millennial Generation was split 
between childhood (under 18 years 
old) and adulthood until the year 
2014, when the youngest millennial 
turned 18. The following year, 2015, 
the oldest members of Generation 
Z entered adulthood. 

Variation within cohorts illuminates 
potential differences in geographic 
mobility. For instance, those 
under 18 years old typically do not 
have the ability to autonomously 
migrate, and therefore rely on 
parental decisions to move. Once 
18 years old, many new adults will 
move out of their parents’ resi-
dence, some to university dormito-
ries and others elsewhere. Adults 
between 25 and 64 years old tend 
to be finished with their educa-
tion and may move for reasons like 
employment or changes in marital 
status. Those 65 years and older 
have decidedly different mobility. 
Some are ending their professional 
careers and have newfound free-
dom to relocate if they so choose. 

What Is the American Community Survey?

The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey 
designed to provide communities with reliable and timely 
demographic, social, economic, and housing data for the nation, 
states, congressional districts, counties, places, and other localities 
every year. It has an annual sample size of about 3.5 million 
addresses across the United States and Puerto Rico and includes 
both housing units and group quarters (e.g., nursing homes and 
prisons). The ACS is conducted in every county throughout the 
nation and in every municipio in Puerto Rico, where it is called 
the Puerto Rico Community Survey. Beginning in 2006, ACS data 
for 2005 were released for geographic areas with populations of 
65,000 and greater. For information on the ACS sample design and 
other topics, visit <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/>.

MEASURING GEOGRAPHIC 
MOBILITY IN THE ACS

This report uses ACS 1-year data to 
examine the relationship between 
geographic mobility and birth 
cohort in the United States. The 
U.S. Census Bureau conducts the 
ACS annually to gather information 
about the socioeconomic, housing, 
and demographic characteristics 

of communities across the United 
States.9 The ACS asks whether 
people 1 year or older lived in 
their current residence at this time 
last year (Figure 2). If they report 
that they lived at their current 
residence last year, they were non-
movers. Those who report living

in a different residence last year 
were movers, or those who were 
geographically mobile. These 
movers are then asked to report 
their prior residence. 

COMPOSITION OF  
U.S. POPULATION BY  
BIRTH COHORT OVER TIME

As time passes, the birth cohort 
composition of the popula-
tion will necessarily change 
(Figure 3). New cohorts are born 
and grow, while older cohorts 
shrink. Between 2005 and 2023, 
the Silent Generation (those 
born between 1928 and 1945) 
decreased from 13.5 percent of 
the U.S. population to 5.3 percent. 
Baby Boomers (born between 
1946 and 1964) declined from 
28.8 percent of the population in 
2005 to 21.0 percent in 2023. On 
the other end of the cohort spec-
trum, Generation Z (born between 
1997 and 2012) occupied only 11.0 
percent of the total population in 
2005 and reached 21.0 percent by 
2023. 

GEOGRAPHIC MOBILITY BY 
BIRTH COHORT

At first glance, there was clear 
variation in geographic mobility 
across birth cohorts (Figure 4). 
Older cohorts (Silent Generation 
and Baby Boomers) tended to 
be less geographically mobile 
than younger cohorts (Millennials, 
Generation Z, and Generation 
Alpha). Between 2005 and 2021, 
the Silent Generation had lower 
mobility rates than any other 
birth cohort, with their lowest rate 
coming in at 5.3 percent in 2009. 
Baby Boomers had mobility rates 
just above the Silent Generation 
in these years, and in 2022 and 
2023 they had lower mobility rates. 
Based on these two examples, 
much is to be learned by examin-
ing mobility rates both between 
and within birth cohorts.

The Silent Generation appears 
to be relatively stationary com-
pared to all other cohorts across 
nearly every data year. In 2005, 6.5 
percent of the Silent Generation 
(born between 1928 and 1945) had 
moved in the last year. By 2010, 
that rate fell to 5.4 percent. In 
2023, when their ages ranged from 
78 to 95 years old, 6.4 percent of 
the Silent Generation had moved 
in the last calendar year. Like the 
Silent Generation, Baby Boomers 
maintained relatively low mobility 
rates across all data years. Only 
two data years, 2005 and 2006, 
showed mover rates that exceeded 
10 percent. From 2007 onward, 

fewer than 10 percent of Baby 
Boomers moved in any given year, 
and, by 2023, 5.8 percent of the 
Baby Boomers had moved in the 
last year. Potential explanations 
for the trends observed in these 
cohorts relate to the age of the 
population and, perhaps, home-
ownership. Public ACS tables show 
that older members of the popula-
tion move at lower rates than their 
younger peers.10 This is particularly

evident among those aged 65 
years and older. Older age groups 
also show higher homeownership 
rates, which may correspond with 
less geographic mobility. Those 
between the ages of 55 and 64, 65 
and 74, and 75 to 84 all maintained 
homeownership rates above 70 
percent in both the 2010 and 2020 
Censuses.11 

In 2005, 23.9 percent of 
Generation X had moved in the last 
calendar year, the highest rate for 
this cohort for the entire period. 
The mobility rates for Generation X 
declined every calendar year, and 
by 2023 rested at 8.3 percent.

The most geographically mobile 
birth cohort between 2006 
and 2022 was Millennials (born 
between 1981 and 1996). In 2006, 
when Millennials’ ages ranged 
from 10 to 25, 23.6 percent moved 
in the last year. In 2014, that rate 
increased to 27.1 percent, the 
highest mobility rate for any birth 
cohort between 2005 and 2023. 
The years 2005 and 2023 were 
the only points in which mover 
rates for Millennials fell below 
Generation X and then Generation 
Z, respectively. The final year of 
this period marked the lowest 
mobility rate for Millennials at 16.7 
percent.

Generation Z, the youngest gen-
eration to have a mover rate in 
every data year in the period, dis-
played mover rates that appeared 
as an inversion of Millennials’. 
Rather than increasing between 
2005 and 2014, the mover rates for 
Generation Z generally declined. In 
2005, when Generation Z ranged 
from ages 1 to 9, 20.6 percent 
moved in the last year. That year 
marked the highest mover rate of 
the period. By 2014, 14.8 percent

of Generation Z had moved in the 
last year. Interestingly, Generation 
Z was the only cohort to expe-
rience increasing geographic 
mobility between 2019 (the year 
immediately preceding the COVID-
19 pandemic) and 2023. Between 
2021 and 2023, the mover rates for 
Generation Z increased from 16.6 
percent to 18.3 percent. 

Generation Alpha (those born 
after 2012) entered the universe 
of movers in 2014 with a mover 
rate of 21.8 percent.12 This cohort’s 
mover rate declined each year 
between 2014 and 2023, when it 
reached 12.4 percent. Generation 
X and Generation Alpha are the 
only birth cohorts to experience 
annual declines for each year in 
the universe.

BIRTH COHORT GEOGRAPHIC 
MOBILITY BY AGE GROUPS

The benefit of examining 
geographic mobility by birth 
cohort is that the data allow for 
disaggregation. It is possible 
to break out birth cohorts into 
meaningful age groups to better 
understand mobility across the 
life course. Four important age 
groups are 1- to 17-year-olds 
(i.e., childhood/adolescence), 
18- to 24-year-olds (i.e., young 
adulthood, college-age), 25- to 
64-year-olds (i.e., adulthood, 
working-age), and 65 years old 
and older (i.e., retirement-age). 

Aged 1 to 17

Geographic mobility among those 
aged 1 to 17 is typically not an 
autonomous decision. Because 
these people are children or ado-
lescents, their mobility reflects that 
of their guardians. As such, this 
group is unique when compared 
to the other three age groups. 
Geographic mobility rates for 1- to 

12 Movers, as defined in the ACS, must be 

1 year old or over. 

17-year-olds generally fell below 
about 22.0 percent (Figure 5). 

Millennials fell into this age group 
between the years 2005 and 2014. 
Child Millennials had lower geo-
graphic mobility rates in every year 
they were in universe than the total 
Millennial population (Figure 4). 
For example, in 2010, Millennials 
between the ages of 1 and 17 had a 
mover rate of 12.3 percent (Figure 
5), while the total Millennial mover 
rate that year was 26.1 percent 
(Figure 4).

Between 2005 and 2014, all of 
Generation Z fell between 1 and 
17 years old, meaning that the 
geographic mobility rate for this 
age group matches the total 
Generation Z geographic mobil-
ity rate in these years. Between 
survey years 2015 and 2023, 
the geographic mobility rate for 
Generation Z was lower in the 1 
to 17 age group (Figure 5) than 
the Generation Z total (Figure 
4). Interestingly, child Generation 
Z maintained higher geographic 
mobility rates than child Millennials 
between 2005 and 2014. 

All of Generation Alpha, who 
entered the universe of potential 
movers in 2014, were between the 
ages of 1 and 17 during the period. 
As such, this age group’s mover 
rate does not differ from that of 
the total Generation Alpha. 

Aged 18 to 24

18- to 24-year-olds represent the 
early stages of adulthood and 
college-age individuals. In this age 
group, many people leave their 
childhood home and relocate to 
attend college or university or to 
establish their own households. 
Millennials at ages 18 to 24 had 
higher geographic mobility rates 
(Figure 6) than the total Millennial 
estimates in each survey year of 
ACS data (Figures 4). In 2021, the

final year that Millennials fell into 
this age group, the total geo-
graphic mobility rate for Millennials 
aged 18 to 24 was 27.8 percent and 
the geographic mobility rate for all 
Millennials was 19.9 percent. 

Generation Z at ages 18 to 24 also 
had higher mover rates than the 
total Generation Z geographic 
mobility rate between 2015 and 
2023 (Figure 4). In 2023, 26.6 
percent of Generation Z between 
18 to 24 years old moved in the last 
year (Figure 6), and 18.3 percent 
of all Generation Z did the same 
(Figure 4).

Aged 25 to 64 

The age group of 25- to 64-year-
olds reflects working-age adults. 
People in this group often have 
completed their educations, if they 

attended post-high school educa-
tion, and entered the workforce. 
The oldest Millennials in the 25 to 
64 age category were between the 
ages of 25 and 41 for this period. 
Millennials in this age group 
largely maintained higher mover 
rates than the total Millennial 
mover rates found in Figure 4. In 
survey year 2006, 36.4 percent 
of Millennials 24 to 64 years old 
moved in the last year, the highest 
geographic mobility rate of any 
birth cohort at any age (Figure 7). 
In other words, over one-third of 
Millennials aged 25 to 64 moved in 
the last year in this survey year.13

Generation X fell entirely within 
the 25- to 64-year-olds age group 
between survey years 2006 and

years old.

2023, so their working-age mobil-
ity rate was the same as their 
overall mobility rate.

For the years 2005 to 2023, Baby 
Boomers in the 25 to 64 age cat-
egory were between the ages of 41 
and 64. Between 2005 and 2012, 
the geographic mobility rates for 
Baby Boomers 25 to 64 years old 
were not different than the total 
Baby Boomer rates (Figure 4). 
From 2013 onward, Baby Boomers 
aged 25 to 64 had higher geo-
graphic mobility than all Baby 
Boomers. For instance, in 2023, 6.5 
percent of Baby Boomers aged 25 
to 64 (Figure 7) and 5.8 percent 
of all Baby Boomers (Figure 4) 
moved in the last year, respectively.

the years 2005 to 2010. The Silent 
Generation maintained higher 
mover rates for each year between 
2005 and 2010 for respondents 25 
to 64 years old relative to the total 
Silent Generation. These are the 
only data years where the Silent 
Generation fell into this age group.

Survey year 2022 marked the 
first year Generation Z entered 
the 25 to 64 age group. In 2022 
and 2023, Generation Z in this 
age group were aged 25 or 26. In 
both 2022 and 2023, Generation 
Z in this age group had higher 
geographic mobility than the total 
Generation Z.

Aged 65 and Older

Age 65 typically reflects retirement 
in the United States. At this stage 
of life, many end their professional 
careers or shift to part-time work. 
This allows for greater flexibility 
in terms of geographic mobility. 

Those in oldest ends of this age 
range may also encounter new 
barriers to geographic mobility in 
the form of illness or disability. The 
only birth cohorts in this age range 
were the Silent Generation and the 
Baby Boomer Generation.

Baby Boomers aged 65 and older 
had lower geographic mobil-
ity rates than Baby Boomers as 
a whole. In 2023, 5.3 percent of 
Baby Boomers aged 65 and older 
(Figure 8) moved in the previous 
year, compared to 5.8 percent of 
all Baby Boomers (Figure 4). 

The Silent Generation 65 years 
and older had lower geographic 
mobility rates than the total Silent 
Generation between 2005 and 
2008 and, by 2009, they were 
essentially the same. By 2011, all 
members of the Silent Generation 
were 65 years and older, mean-
ing that their geographic mobility 

rates did not differ from that of the 
total Silent Generation.

SUMMARY

Time is an essential component in 
understanding geographic mobil-
ity. As the ACS 1-year data show, 
changes in geographic mobility are 
not uniform over time. Across most 
survey years in the ACS 1-year 
data, the Millennial Generation had 
the highest geographic mobility 
rates compared to all other birth 
cohorts. These higher rates per-
sisted even with overall declines in 
geographic mobility from 2015 to 
2022. The Silent Generation and 
Baby Boomers experienced low 
and relatively stable geographic 
mobility rates across the period. 
Between survey years 2021 and 
2023, the first 3 years of ACS 
1-year data available following the 
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
only Generation Z saw increased 
geographic mobility.

1 In data year 2014, there is one case in which year of birth is 1997 and age is 18 or older. For consistency, this case is excluded from analyses.
2 In data year 2015, there are 16 cases in which year of birth is 1996 and age is less than 18, but all of these cases have a response 
date in November or December of 2014 with a date of birth being after the response date. For consistency, these 16 cases are 
excluded from analyses.

Disaggregating birth cohorts by 
age group shows that geographic 
mobility rates differed even 
within birth cohorts. College-age 
Millennials and Generation Z had 
higher geographic mobility rates 
than their respective total birth 
cohort estimates. Baby Boomers 
had lower geographic mobility for 
those 65 years and older than all 
Baby Boomers. This report only 
begins to shed light on the com-
plex nature of geographic mobil-
ity and highlights some of the key 
characteristics associated with its 
variability.

SOURCE AND ACCURACY

The data presented in this report 
are based on American Community 
Survey (ACS) samples interviewed 
from January 1 through December 
31 for each of the years between 
2005 and 2019 and each of the 
years between 2021 and 2023. 
The estimates based on these 
samples describe the average 
values of person, household, and 
housing unit characteristics over 
this period of collection. Sampling 
error is the uncertainty between 
an estimate based on a sample 
and the corresponding value 
that would be obtained if the 
estimate were based on the entire 
population (as from a census). 
Measures of sampling error are 

provided in the form of margins 
of error for all estimates included 
in this report. All comparative 
statements in this report have 
undergone statistical testing at the 
90 percent confidence level, unless 
otherwise noted. In addition to 
sampling error, nonsampling error 
may be introduced during any 
of the operations used to collect 
and process survey data, such as 
editing, reviewing, or keying data 
from questionnaires. For more 
information on sampling and 
estimation methods, confidentiality 
protection, and sampling and 
nonsampling errors, refer to the

document at <www.census.gov/
