We ask a question about the relationship of each person in a

household to one central person to create estimates about

families, households, and other groups, and to present other

data at a household level.

Local, state, tribal, and federal agencies use relationship data

to plan and fund government programs that provide funds or

services for families, people living or raising children alone,

grandparents living with grandchildren, or other households

that qualify for additional assistance.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci

and law enforcement.

Relationship data help communities:

Provide Adequate Housing

We want to know about how people in households are related (single people, couples, families, roommates, etc.), in combination

with household income and housing costs, to help communities understand whether housing is affordable and meets the needs 

residents. When housing is not sufﬁcient or affordable, relationship data can help communities:

Enroll eligible households in programs designed to assist them.
Qualify for grants from the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnership Program, Emergency Solutions

Grants (ESG), Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA), and other programs.

Provide Assistance to Families

We ask about family relationships, ages of children, household income, and health insurance status to help communities:

Enroll eligible families in programs designed to assist them, such as Head Start and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
Qualify for grants to fund these programs.
Evaluate programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).

Understand Changing Households

We ask about relationship to householder to create statistics on living arrangements and how they are changing. This helps

communities plan future programs and services for residents by considering whether older residents are staying in their homes a

they age, whether young people are living with parents or moving in with roommates, and which kinds of households include
young children. For example, the Social Security Administration estimates future program needs based on the current

relationships of working people.

History of relationship to householder question

The relationship to householder question originated with the 1880 Census. It was added to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the
decennial census long form. The question was modiﬁed in 2019. Research about this modiﬁcation

[https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2017/acs/2017_Kreider_01.html] and copies of previous questionnaires
[https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaire-archive.2018.html] are available on the ACS website
