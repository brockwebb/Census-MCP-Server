Understanding and Using
Puerto Rico Community
Survey Data: What All Data
Users Need to Know

April 2020

Suppose a mayor wants to know if a
job training initiative has reduced the

level of unemployment in a
municipio. A business owner in San

Juan wants information about the
changing characteristics of
workers and their commuting
patterns. A public health agency is
interested in identifying vulnerable

populations that may need
evacuation assistance during an
emergency. Where could they go for
this information?

The U.S. Census Bureau’s Puerto
Rico Community Survey (PRCS) is

designed to meet the needs of
policymakers, business leaders,
planners, and others who need good
data to make informed decisions.
The PRCS is part of the Census
Bureau’s American
Community Survey (ACS) program,
providing a detailed portrait of the
social, economic, housing, and
demographic characteristics of
communities throughout Puerto
Rico.

Puerto Rico.
