(which includes elementary and secondary, higher, 
and other education), employed 11.3 million people. 
Among those public education employees, 8.4 million 
worked at the local government level, primarily 
in elementary and secondary education. State 
governments employed another 2.9 million education 
employees, mostly in higher education. Hospitals 
were the next largest functional category with 1.2 
million state and local government employees. Of 
those employees, 0.7 million worked at the local 
government level and 0.5 million worked at the 
state government level. Police protection, including 
people with power of arrest as well as other police 
support staff, accounted for 1.0 million workers for 
state and local governments. Local level governments 
employed 0.9 million of all police protection workers 
and 0.1 million worked at the state government level.
