Understanding and Using
American Community
Survey Data: What
Researchers Need to Know

April 2020

The American Community Survey
(ACS) is the nation’s premier source

of detailed social, economic,
housing, and demographic

characteristics for local
communities.

This handbook describes how
researchers can use ACS data to
make comparisons, create custom
tables, and combine ACS data with
other data sources.  It is aimed at
researchers who are familiar with
using data—summary tabulations
and microdata records—from
complex sample surveys.
