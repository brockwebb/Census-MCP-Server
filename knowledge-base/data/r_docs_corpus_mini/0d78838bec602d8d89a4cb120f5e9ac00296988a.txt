We ask questions about where people work, how they get

there, when they leave home, and how long it takes, to create

statistics about commuting, or a person's journey to work.

Commuting patterns and characteristics are crucial to planning

for improvements to road and highway infrastructure,

developing transportation plans and services, and

understanding where people are traveling in the course of a

normal day.

"I Don't Want Everyone to Know What Time I Leave"

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci

and law enforcement.

Questions as they appear on the form

We ask ﬁve questions about a person's journey to work to create a proﬁle of a community's
commuting patterns.

Results from these questions

We compile the results from these questions to provide communities with important statistics to help in their transportation and
infrastructure planning. You can see some of these published statistics here for the nation, states, and your community.

How these statistics are used to help your community

Transportation Planning

Local, state, and federal transportation agencies use these statistics to plan programs and services for disabled populations,

bicycle commuters, carpools and ride shares. These agencies conduct long-range planning for transportation that rely on travel

demand forecasting models. The federal Department of Transportation (DOT) need these statistics to ensure compliance with

various regulations, to understand current uses, and forecast future transportation needs throughout the nation.

People at Work

Understanding commuting patterns and where people work also helps with:

Employment planning.
Protection against employment discrimination.
Defining banking and housing markets.
Planning emergency response, etc.

Useful for businesses:

A coffee shop might want to be located where people work.
A movie theater might want to be located where people live.

Understanding How Commuting Affects Us

Researchers use these estimates to study the effects of long commutes on health (obesity, hypertension, etc.), and on the
environment (emissions, contaminants, etc.).

History of commuting / journey to work questions

The question about how people get to work originated with the 1960 Census. The question about where a person worked
originated with the 1970 Census The question about how long it took people to get to work originated with the 1980 Census and

the time of departure question originated with the 1990 Census. They were transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the
decennial census long form.

The questions about how people get to work and their departure time for work were modiﬁed in 2019. Research about this

modiﬁcation [https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2017/acs/2017_McKenzie_01.html] and copies of previous
questionnaires [https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaire-archive.2018.html] are available on th

ACS website.
