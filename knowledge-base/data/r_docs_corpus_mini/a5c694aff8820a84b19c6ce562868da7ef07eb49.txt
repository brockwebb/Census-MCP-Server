INTRODUCTION

According to estimates from the 2022 Survey of 
Income and Program Participation (SIPP), over 30 
million American adults aged 18 to 64 were living 
with a disability.1, 2, 3, 4 For some of these individuals, 
the nature or severity of their disability could affect 
employment and other economic outcomes. Several 
social safety net programs and other income sources 
exist to support individuals whose health or disability 
limit their potential employment, but eligibility require-
ments for such programs vary. Perhaps as a result, 
adults with a disability have lower income than their 
counterparts without disability (Figure 1). This report 
uses data from the 2022 SIPP to examine the inter-
section between disability status, employment, and 
participation in a variety of social support programs 
in order to better understand this gap in income 
between individuals with and without a disability.

civilian, noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 to 64.

2 For additional estimates for employment and disability, refer to 
the American Community Survey (ACS) at <https://data.census.gov/
table?t=Disability&tid=ACSDT1Y2021.B18120>.

3 “Disability” is defined using the standardized 6-question measure 

used within the ACS, which captures functional difficulties in vision, 
hearing, cognition, ambulation, self-care, and independent living. 
National estimates of disability prevalence produced using SIPP data 
may be higher than estimates from other federal surveys that use the 
same disability measure. Refer to the “Limitations” section for more 
information.

HIGHLIGHTS

•  The population aged 18 to 64 

with a disability was more likely 
to be female, be older, have 
lower educational attainment, 
and have lower self-rated health 
than the population without 
disability.

•  While many adults with a dis-

ability were employed in 2021, 
the employment rate among 
those with a disability was sig-
nificantly lower than the rate for 
those without a disability: about 
82 percent of people without a 
disability were employed, com-
pared to roughly 54 percent of 
people with a disability.

•  Workers with a disability were 

more likely to be self-employed, 
more likely to work nonstan-
dard schedules, and more likely 
to work part-time jobs than 
their counterparts without a 
disability.

•  Roughly 32 percent of not 

employed, working-age adults  
with a disability received Social 
Security because of a disabil-
ity, while roughly 21 percent 
received Supplemental Security 
Income (SSI). Approximately 8 
percent received some other 
form of disability income. 

•  About 30 percent of working-

age adults with a disability who 
were not employed did not 
receive any benefits.

•  Individuals with a disability were 
more likely to participate in mul-
tiple programs than their coun-
terparts without a disability.5

•  For adults who worked less than 
full-time, year-round, median 
personal income was signifi-
cantly lower for those with a 
disability than for those without 

5 Program participation refers to receipt 

of benefits from a variety of cash and 
noncash sources, which may be formal or 
informal and are discussed in greater detail

ABOUT THE SIPP

The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is a 
nationally representative, longitudinal survey administered by the 
U.S. Census Bureau that provides comprehensive information on 
the dynamics of income, employment, household composition, 
and government program participation. The SIPP is also a leading 
source of data on economic well-being, family dynamics, education, 
wealth, health insurance, child care, and food security. The SIPP 
interviews individuals for several years and provides monthly data 
about changes in household and family composition and economic 
circumstances over time. Visit the SIPP website at <www.census.gov/
sipp> for more information. 

a disability, regardless of  
program participation.

WHAT IS A DISABILITY?

Disability is a complex process 
between individuals and their 
environment.6 Broadly speaking, 
individuals may experience a dis-
ability if they have difficulty with 
certain daily tasks due to a physi-
cal, mental, or emotional condi-
tion. Disability as a population 
phenomenon is inherently diverse. 
Some people may experience an 
invisible disability, while for others 
it may be more readily apparent. 
Disabilities may also vary—both in 
initial onset and expression over 
time. Some disabilities are consid-
ered only temporary conditions 
with immediate short-term effects 
on individuals’ health and well-
being, while others may be more 
permanent conditions with long-
lasting effects. 

Public policies may affect the 
ability of individuals to participate 
in the labor force or supplement 
their income when a disability 
inhibits work. For instance, some 
laws seek to facilitate employ-
ment by providing reasonable 

6 For information on federal definitions of 

disability, refer to New Editions Consulting,

Disability,” prepared for the Interagency 
Committee on Disability Research, 2024,

Disability_508_3ba4b711de.pdf>.

accommodations to enable work 
or by reducing physical barriers 
that might impede work. Other 
laws, such as the Americans with 
Disabilities Act, legislate fairness 
during the hiring process or on the 
job by prohibiting discrimination 
against individuals based on dis-
ability. Meanwhile, there is also a 
social safety net of programs avail-
able to those in need. Notably for 
those with a disability, some forms 
of social welfare and other ben-
efits require labor force engage-
ment, and therefore may preclude 
benefit receipt. Others require 
that individuals have a condition 
that prevents them from working 
as one of the criteria for eligibility, 
thereby facilitating benefit receipt. 

Measures of disability in the SIPP 
are based on individual reports of 
functional difficulty, as opposed to 
medical diagnoses.7 In this analysis, 
disability is defined using the stan-
dardized measure of six questions 
used currently within the American 
Community Survey (ACS). Using 
this measure, individuals are con-
sidered to have a disability if they 
have vision, hearing, cognitive, 
ambulatory, self-care, or indepen-
dent living difficulty. All references 

7 Individual reports may be self-reports 

or proxy reports—that is, a report from 
another person in the household aged 15 or 
over. If disability reports were not obtained 
from survey respondents, then answers were 
statistically imputed.

to “disability” throughout this 
report rely on this definition. 

Notably, measures of disability in 
the SIPP are collected at the time 
of interview (in this report, early 
2022), while measures of employ-
ment status and program receipt 
are collected with reference to 
the calendar year preceding the 
interview (in this report, 2021). 
Further details are available in the 
“Limitations” section.

The SIPP also collects information 
on other concepts related to dis-
ability, including (but not limited 
to) whether respondents have a 
work-limiting health condition; 
whether they have difficulty find-
ing a job or remaining employed 
due to a physical, mental, or emo-
tional problem; and whether they 
are prevented from working due 
to a physical, mental, or emotional

problem. To avoid complicating 
findings related to employment 
and in the interest of maintain-
ing consistency across Census 
Bureau products, these concepts 
are not included in the definition 
of disability used throughout this 
report.8

WHO EXPERIENCES 
DISABILITY?

Table 1 shows how working-age 
adults (aged 18 to 64) differed 
across demographic characteris-
tics by disability status. Among the 
population living with a disability, 
53.2 percent were women and 
46.8 percent were men. Among 
the population without a disabil-
ity, the percentage of women and 
men was not statistically different 
(50.3 percent and 49.7 percent,

ence of a work-limiting health condition is 
included in Table 2.

respectively). Select race and 
ethnicity groups were also dispro-
portionally represented among 
those with a disability, including 
White alone (77.7 percent of those 
with a disability were White alone, 
compared to 75.0 percent of those 
without a disability), Black or 
African American alone (15.0 per-
cent with a disability compared to 
13.5 percent without a disability), 
and any other race group alone or 
combination (4.5 percent with a 
disability compared to 3.5 percent 
without a disability).9

9 Federal surveys now give respondents 
the option of reporting more than one race. 
Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race 
group are possible. A group such as Asian 
may be defined as those who reported 
Asian and no other race (the race-alone 
or single-race concept) or as those who 
reported Asian regardless of whether they 
also reported another race (the race-alone-
or-in-combination concept). Table 1 shows 
data using the first approach (race-alone). 
People who identify as Hispanic may be any 
race. Data in Table 1 for Hispanics overlap 
with data for racial groups.

People with a disability tended to 
be older than adults without a dis-
ability; they also had lower educa-
tional attainment. The median age 
for working-age individuals with 
a disability was 45.9 years, com-
pared with 38.8 years for those 
without a disability. Educational 
attainment was lower among 
adults with a disability compared 
with their counterparts without a 
disability. A higher percentage of 
adults with a disability reported 
not having a high school diploma 
compared with those without a 
disability (12.9 percent and 7.4 
percent, respectively). 

Additionally, people may experi-
ence limitations in multiple func-
tional domains. Among those with 
a disability, 44.7 percent reported 
having more than one type of 
functional limitation. 

Self-rated health, a conventional 
measure using a single question 
rating one’s overall health using 
graded answer categories, has 
been validated as an indicator of 
health across a variety of popula-
tions and shown to predict mor-
bidity, health services use, and 
mortality.10

Figure 2 shows the relationship 
between disability and self-rated 
health among SIPP respondents.11

are not conducted by a doctor, but instead 
are reported by the person or a proxy adult.

Overall, people with a disability 
were in worse health than those 
without a disability. Significantly 
more individuals with any disability 
were also reported to be in “poor” 
health compared to those with no 
disability. Likewise, a significantly 
higher percentage of those with-
out a disability reported “very 
good” or “excellent” health.

one job. However, the employ-
ment rate for the population with 
a disability was significantly lower 
than the rate for those without 
a disability—about 54 percent 
of people with a disability were 
employed, compared with about 
82 percent of people without a 
disability. Individuals with a dis-
ability were also more likely than 
those without a disability to have 
a health condition that limited the 
amount or kind of work they were 
able to do. Among the population 
with a disability, about 16 percent 
were workers with a work-limiting 
health condition, while almost 35 
percent had a work-limiting health 
condition and did not work.

The SIPP data also illustrate how 
workers with a disability were 
represented among a select class 
of worker groups, or by the type 
of their employer’s organization 
(Figure 3). For instance, workers 
with a disability were more likely 
to be self-employed (about 12 per-
cent) than those without disability 
(about 10 percent). Conversely, 
the likelihood of an individual’s 
employment in a private business 
or in government did not vary sig-
nificantly by disability status.

individuals with a disability with 
nonmonetary benefits such as 
increased flexibility at work.13 Self-

to individuals with a disability 
by allowing them to manage 
their own hours or duties despite 
physical or health limitations.

of workers across 23 occupation 
groups among populations with 
any disability and no disability.

three of the top occupation groups 
were office and administrative 
support (12.6 percent), sales and 
related (9.4 percent), and manage-
ment (9.4 percent). 

These data show how individuals 
with a disability were more likely 
to be concentrated in select jobs 
based on the kind of work con-
ducted compared to those without 
a disability. For instance, work-
ers with a disability were more 
likely to be employed in office and 
administrative support occupa-
tions compared with those without 
a disability (12.6 percent and 9.7  
percent, respectively). Workers 
with a disability were also about 
2 percentage points more likely 
to be employed in (1) building 
and grounds cleaning and main-
tenance and (2) material moving 
occupations. 

Conversely, workers with a disabil-
ity were less likely to be employed 
in select occupations compared 
with workers without a disability. 
Specifically, they were less likely 
to work in healthcare practitio-
ners and technical occupations 
by about 2 percentage points. 
While numerically a large number 
of workers with a disability were 
employed in management occupa-
tions, an even greater proportion 
of individuals without a disability 
were employed in these same jobs. 
In other words, management occu-
pations were common jobs among 
all workers but were more likely 
to employ individuals without a 
disability.

Table 3 shows how selected job 
characteristics varied by workers’ 
disability status. Notable differ-
ences between the populations 

DISABILITY INCOME SOURCES

A variety of programs exist that offer income directed toward the 
population with a disability. Some of these are government transfer 
programs. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is administered 
by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and offers benefits if an 
individual worked for a sufficient period, paid Social Security taxes, 
and has a condition that meets the SSA’s definition of disability. 
Individuals have a qualifying disability under SSDI if they (1) cannot 
do work and engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA), (2) cannot 
do work they did previously or adjust to other work, and (3) have a 
condition that has lasted or is expected to last for at least 1 year or 
to result in death.

The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is also adminis-
tered by the SSA and provides monthly payments to adults and chil-
dren with a disability or blindness who have income and resources 
below specific financial limits, as well as people aged 65 and over 
without a disability who meet the financial qualifications.

Individuals with a disability may also be eligible to receive workers’ 
compensation and disability income from sources other than gov-
ernment transfer programs, such as employer disability payments; 
payments from a sickness, accident, or disability insurance policy; 
or disability payments from a federal, state, or local government 
pension.

with and without a disability 
include hours worked, part-time 
or full-time employment status, 
schedule arrangements, and type 
of work arrangement. For example, 
people with a disability worked 
about 3 hours fewer each week 
than those without a disability.

A smaller percentage of workers 
with a disability worked full-time, 
year-round compared with work-
ers without a disability—about 53 
percent and 65 percent, respec-
tively. These differences similarly 
extended to whether workers 
engaged in part-time or full-time 
employment. Nearly 30 percent 
of jobs held by workers with a dis-
ability were part-time, or less than 

35 hours per week. In comparison, 
only 20 percent of the those with-
out a disability worked part-time. 

Schedules also differed between 
workers by disability status. 
Workers with a disability were 
more likely to work nonstandard 
schedules (either predictable or

14 Predictable, nonstandard work sched-
ules include regular evening or night shifts, 
rotating shifts, and split shifts. Unpredictable, 
nonstandard work schedules include irregu-
lar schedules or ones that change from day 
to day.

15 Additional cross-tabulations (not 
shown) suggest self-employment further 
affects the relationship between work 
schedules and disability status such that 
nonstandard work schedules were even more 
common among self-employed workers with 
a disability compared with those who were 
not self-employed.

Differences in type of work 
arrangement (e.g., home-based, 
mixed or “hybrid,” or in-person) 
by disability status also suggest 
that jobs for those with disability 
may be less flexible than other 
jobs. During the COVID-19 pan-
demic, the prevalence of home-
based work increased dramatically 
among the broader population. 
According to a recent Census 
Bureau report, the number of 
home-based workers almost 
tripled between 2019 and 2021, 
increasing from roughly 9 million 
to 27.6 million workers.16 Yet com-
pared with the population without 
a disability, fewer workers with a 
disability worked from home all or 
part of the time in 2021.

Brian McKenzie, “Home-Based Workers 
and the COVID-19 Pandemic,” American 
Community Survey Reports, ACS-52,  
U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, 2023.

These findings remained consistent 
even after excluding self-employed 
workers. Research suggests that 
these lower levels of home-based 
work among people with a dis-
ability may be due to the kinds of 
jobs in which they were employed, 
such as service occupations.17 More 
workers with a disability may also 
work in occupations with lower 
expected growth rates for telework 
eligibility.18 In other words, work-
ers with a disability could be more 
likely to work in jobs that require 
onsite employment during a time 
of rapidly expanding remote-work 
options.

OTHER INCOME SOURCES 
FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH A 
DISABILITY

As reflected above, while many 
adults aged 18 to 64 with a 
disability work for pay, others are 
unable to work due to a disability, 
or have to work reduced hours due 
to their condition. Such individuals 
may rely on other sources of 
income to make ends meet. Some 
of the more common sources 
of program income in which a 
disability determines eligibility are 
described in greater detail in the 
box “Disability Income Sources.”

Overall, roughly 45 percent of indi-
viduals with a disability received 
income or noncash benefits from 
at least one source in 2021, com-
pared with about 14 percent of 

8 

U.S. Census Bureau

 
 
those without a disability (not 
shown).19

Roughly 32 percent of working-
age adults with a disability who 
were not employed in 2021 
received Social Security because 
of a disability, while roughly 21 
percent received Supplemental 
Security Income (SSI) and 2 
percent received workers’ com-
pensation payments (Figure 5).20 
Approximately 8 percent received 
some other form of disability 
income.

However, as these estimates indi-
cate, many adults with a disability 
who were not employed did not 
receive benefits stemming from 
their disability. Temporal differ-
ences in survey measurement 
(refer to the “Limitations” section) 
may contribute to this outcome. 
Individuals may also choose not 
to apply for benefits or apply for 
benefits and be denied—the SSA’s 
rate of denied applications for 
SSDI averaged 67 percent between 
2010 and 2019.21 According to SSA 
records, technical denials—denials 
for nonmedical reasons—represent 
the most common denial, which 
may partially explain the gap 
between the overall prevalence of 

19 In this context, “benefit” refers to 
receipt of Social Security; Supplemental 
Security Income (SSI); Temporary Assistance 
for Needy Families (TANF); Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); 
General Assistance; Special Supplemental 
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children (WIC); unemployment compensa-
tion; workers’ compensation; and other 
disability income.

20 The SIPP asks whether individuals 
receive Social Security and the reason for 
receipt. It does not explicitly ask about 
receipt of Social Security Disability Insurance 
(SSDI).

disability and the rate of receipt of 
disability-related benefits.22

Many working-age adults with a 
disability receive other forms of 
assistance that are not specifically 
targeted toward those with a dis-
ability but are instead intended to 
alleviate economic hardship more 
generally. For example, roughly 35 
percent of adults with a disability 
who were not employed in 2021 
received SNAP, an in-kind form of 
food support for low-income fami-
lies that is among the largest social 
safety net programs.

22 A medical denial means that an appli-
cant did not meet the medical criteria con-
sistent with SSDI’s definition of a disability. 
A technical denial means that an applicant 
was denied SSDI for a nonmedical reason 
(for example, paperwork errors, etc.). Refer 
to the ”Limitations” section for additional 
information regarding what can and cannot 
be determined from SIPP data regarding 
program uptake.

OVERLAPPING RECEIPT

Individuals with a disability were 
also much more likely to receive 
income from multiple programs in 
2021 than their counterparts with-
out a disability (Figure 6). Among 
individuals without a disability, just 
under 1 in 5 of those receiving at 
least one form of program income, 
received income from multiple 
sources. By contrast, about 2 in 5 
individuals with a disability, receiv-
ing any program income, received 
income from more than one source. 

These differences are even more 
dramatic when further broken 
down by employment status. 
About 32 percent of adults with a 
disability who were not employed 
received more than one form of 
program income. By contrast, just 
6 percent of adults with a disability 
who were employed received mul-
tiple forms of program income.

As results presented below reflect, 
receiving income from multiple 
programs does not necessarily 
imply greater income. Rather, 
these differences reflect the way in 
which individuals with a disability, 
and particularly those who are not 
employed, often subsist by relying 
on a combination of benefits from 
multiple sources.

DISABILITY, EMPLOYMENT, 
PROGRAM PARTICIPATION, 
AND INCOME

Figure 7 ties together the findings 
of this report by presenting the 
interrelationship between employ-
ment status, disability status, and 
program participation with respect 
to median personal income. Adults 
aged 18 to 64 with a disability 
who were employed full-time, 
year-round had median personal 
income of $50,000, compared 
with median personal income of 
$60,200 among full-time, year-
round workers without a disability. 

Among employed individuals with 
a disability who were not full-time, 
year-round workers, programs did 
not act as a one-to-one replace-
ment for income from employment: 
median income among those with 
a disability who were employed 
less than full-time, year-round was 
dramatically lower ($22,570 for 
those with no program income and 
$17,350 for those with program 
income) than for those who were 
employed full-time, year-round. 
Additionally, for those with a dis-
ability who were employed less 
than full-time, year-round, median 
income was lower than that of 
those without a disability who 
were employed less than full-time, 
year-round regardless of program 
participation—an indication of the 
unique challenges faced by indi-
viduals with a disability.23 

23 The difference between the median 
income of those without a disability and 
employed less than full-time with program 
income and those with a disability who were 
employed less than full-time with no pro-
gram income was not statistically significant.

Individuals with a disability who 
were not employed and received 
program income had lower median 
personal income ($10,490) than 
their counterparts who were 
employed, regardless of whether 
that work was full-time or less than 
full-time, year-round. Additionally, 
among those with a disability who 
were not employed, those with 
income from more than one pro-
gram had median personal income 
($10,200) that did not differ sta-
tistically from those with income 
from just one program ($10,790), 
reflecting the way in which indi-
viduals may pool together income 
from multiple programs in order to 
help make ends meet.

SUMMARY

This report highlights the relation-
ship between disability, employ-
ment, and benefit receipt. The 
majority of working-age adults 
with a disability worked in 2021,

though they were more likely to 
work in jobs that emphasized part-
time or less than full-year employ-
ment than those without a disabil-
ity. Workers with a disability were 
also more likely to hold nonstan-
dard work schedules compared to 
those without a disability. However, 
overall employment rates were 
lower for those with a disability 
than for their counterparts with-
out a disability. Those who did not 
work, or who worked fewer hours, 
due to a disability often received 
assistance from other sources, 
including cash and noncash ben-
efits from government transfer 
programs and other forms of dis-
ability income. However, many of 
those who were disabled and not 
employed did not receive these 
benefits. Those who did receive 
benefits often combined benefits 
from multiple sources.

Median income for individuals 
with a disability who worked less 
than full-time, year-round was 
lower than that of those who were 
employed less than full-time, year-
round and did not have a disability, 
regardless of program participa-
tion. These findings demonstrate 
the complex interaction between 
employment patterns and benefit 
receipt and the unique challenges 
faced by individuals with a disabil-
ity in making ends meet. 

LIMITATIONS

A number of limitations should be 
noted in interpreting the findings 
presented in this report. First, 
disability is a complex popula-
tion phenomenon, and thus there 
is no single universal definition 
of “disability.” This report defines 
disability based on a standard-
ized disability question set that 
is currently used in the ACS. This 

measure defines disability based 
on the presence of at least one 
of these six functional limitations: 
difficulty seeing; difficulty hear-
ing; difficulty walking or climbing; 
difficulty concentrating, remem-
bering, or making decisions; dif-
ficulty dressing or bathing; and/
or difficulty doing errands alone. 
Other concepts such as a “work-
limiting health condition” capture 
a different population and are only 
referenced in conjunction with 
the standardized disability ques-
tion set in specific instances in 
this report. It should also be noted 
that specific governmental agen-
cies such as the SSA use their own 
eligibility-based definitions when 
administering benefit programs.

Given these varying definitions, 
the SIPP cannot measure who is 
eligible to participate in programs 
such as SSDI. Those with a disabil-
ity who are not receiving a given

benefit may not be eligible for 
the program because they do not 
meet the program’s definition of 
disability or because they do not 
meet some other program require-
ment. Alternatively, they may be 
eligible to receive a benefit but 
are not receiving it for any of a 
number of reasons, including being 
unaware that they are eligible, 
facing administrative hurdles, or 
opting not to participate. The SIPP 
cannot distinguish among these 
reasons, or between those who 
are ineligible and those who are 
eligible but do not receive a given 
benefit. Furthermore, the SIPP 
does not ask respondents directly 
about receipt of SSDI. Rather, it 
asks respondents if they received 
Social Security and, if so, for what 
reason, with “disability” as an 
answer choice.

Additionally, the 2022 SIPP was 
administered during February 
through June of 2022 to produce 
a person-month dataset of ret-
rospective measures of the prior 
calendar year (2021). However, 
questions on disability and self-
rated health are conventionally 
asked without reference to any 
reference period, and thus are an 
implicit measure of current dis-
ability or health status at the time 
of interview. While these point-
in-time measures of health and 
disability are reasonably reflective 
of health and disability during the 
prior calendar year (the reference 
period for the work and program 
participation data), some variation 
between the two measures exists 
and cannot be captured using the 
SIPP data.

National estimates of disability 
prevalence and patterns over time 
vary across surveys. For this rea-
son, this report focuses on associa-
tions between disability status and 
other variables, rather than gener-
ating estimates of the prevalence 
of disability. Additional informa-
tion can be found at <www.census.

SOURCE AND ACCURACY 

Statistics from surveys are subject 
to sampling and nonsampling 
error. All comparisons presented 
in this report have taken 
sampling error into account 
and are significant at the 90 
percent confidence level, unless 
otherwise noted. This means the 
90 percent confidence interval 
for the difference between the 
estimates being compared does 
not include zero. Nonsampling 
errors in surveys may be attributed 
to a variety of sources, such as 
how the survey was designed, how 
respondents interpret questions, 
how able and willing respondents 
are to provide correct answers, 
and how accurately the answers 
are coded and classified.  
To minimize these errors, the 
Census Bureau employs quality 
control procedures throughout the 
production process, including the 
overall design of surveys, wording 
of questions, review of the work 
of interviewers and coders, and 
the statistical review of reports.
