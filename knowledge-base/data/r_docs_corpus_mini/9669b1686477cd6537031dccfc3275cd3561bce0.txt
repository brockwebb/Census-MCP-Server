Improvements to the
Hispanic Origin Question

November 2021

Beginning in 2020, the Census Bureau implemented changes to the Hispanic origin question based on

extensive research and outreach over the past decade. For more information please see the 2010
Census Race and Hispanic Origin Alternative Questionnaire Experiment [/programs-surveys/decennial-

census/decade/2010/program-management/cpex/2010-cpex-211.html] and the 2015 National Content

Test [/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/planning-management/plan/final-

analysis/2015nct-race-ethnicity-analysis.html] .

Building upon our research over the past decade, we improved the Hispanic origin question design and

updated our data processing and coding procedures for the 2020 ACS.

Although the 2020 ACS Hispanic origin question included the same three detailed checkboxes (“Mexican,

Mexican Am., Chicano,” “Puerto Rican,” “Cuban”), along with a “Yes, another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish
origin” checkbox that was included in the 2019 ACS, there were two important changes to the 2020 ACS

Hispanic origin question:

The instruction to “Print origin, for example” was revised to “Print, for example.”

The example groups were revised from “Argentinean, Colombian, Dominican, Nicaraguan, Salvadoran, Spaniard, and so on.” to
“Salvadoran, Dominican, Colombian, Guatemalan, Spaniard, Ecuadorian, etc.” in order to represent the largest Hispanic
population groups and the geographic diversity of the Hispanic or Latino category, as defined by the U.S. Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) guidelines [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1997-10-30/pdf/97-28653.pdf] .

Additionally, improvements were made to the way write-in responses to the Hispanic origin question

were processed and coded. The number of characters captured in each write-in area was increased from
30 to 200. Instead of prioritizing multiple responses into only two codes, up to six detailed codes for

each write-in area were coded.

The improvements made to the 2020 ACS Hispanic origin question design, processing, and coding are

similar to changes made in the 2020 Census, which are presented in the blog entitled, ‘Improvements to
the 2020 Census Race and Hispanic Origin Question Designs, Data Processing, and Coding Procedures’
