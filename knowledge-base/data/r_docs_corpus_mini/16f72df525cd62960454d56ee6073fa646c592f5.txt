Questions and Answers About Sources of Poverty Data 

1. What data sources do you recommend being used at a state and county level for 
measuring poverty over time - specifically from 2000 forward? Why would you want to use 
C2SS over the Census 2000?  Would the CPS be appropriate? 

Following the Office of Management and Budget’s Statistical Policy Directive 14, the Census 
Bureau calculates official poverty estimates for the nation from the CPS.  Because of the 
advantages of the ACS with regard to sample size and design, the Census Bureau recommends 
using the ACS poverty estimates for states and counties.  

State Level 
If you are interested in comparing current STATE estimates of poverty with poverty estimates 
for 2000, the Census Bureau recommends using the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey (C2SS) 
estimates and the most recent ACS estimates.  For additional comparisons of poverty over time 
at the state level you should use the ACS series of estimates, including both the 2000-2004 
supplementary surveys and the 2005-2007 full implementation surveys. Because they are the 
same survey, factors that may affect comparisons of estimates are minimized.  Therefore, it’s 
preferable to use C2SS estimates over Census 2000 estimates for states.   

It should be noted that in 2006 the ACS sample was expanded to include the group quarters (GQ) 
population and poverty rates increased as a result.  The effect of this universe change varied by 
state, depending on the composition of the population.  For a preliminary assessment of the 
effect, the Census Bureau compared state poverty rates for the 2006 ACS with and without the 
GQ population.  Adjustment factors were calculated by taking the percentage point difference 
between the 2006 poverty rate for the total population and the 2006 poverty rate for the 
household only population.  Subtracting the adjustment factors from the ACS estimates for years 
2006 and beyond adjusts these estimates to eliminate the GQ population.  These factors can be 
found in the attachment. 

To assess the degree to which these differences would have affected state-level poverty 
comparisons between 2000 and 2007, the Census Bureau adjusted the C2SS poverty estimates to 
account for the missing GQ population. Comparisons were made of these adjusted estimates with 
the 2007 ACS estimates.  Based on this assessment, five states that had shown statistically higher 
poverty in 2007 (total population universe) compared with 2000 (household only population 
universe) were no longer significantly different when adjustment factors were applied.  

For years prior to 2000, the CPS would be the only option and for state-level comparisons we 
recommend using multiyear averages.

County Level      

If you are interested in comparing current COUNTY-LEVEL estimates of poverty with poverty 
estimates for 2000, the Census Bureau recommends using Census 2000 and the most recent 
ACS.  County-level estimates for 2001 – 2004 are not available for comparisons with current 
ACS estimates.  Beginning with the 2005 ACS, county-level comparisons are possible for 
measuring poverty over time.  

While we generally do not recommend making comparisons across surveys when possible, in 
this case the lower variance of the Census 2000 estimates represent a clear advantage over the 
C2SS. A 2004 C2SS/Census 2000 evaluation study (see 
http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/Report05.pdf ) found that, while Census 2000 and 
C2SS had many methodological and operational differences, a comparison of poverty estimates 
found that  "...data users would likely come to similar conclusions and therefore would be likely 
to implement support programs and allocate funds in a similar fashion, regardless of whether 
they used the Census 2000 Sample or the C2SS data." Obviously, any comparison across surveys 
should only be undertaken after taking the time to understand the differences between these 
surveys and their potential impact on the data.  

For more guidance, please refer to: http://www.census.gov/acs/www/UseData/compACS.htm 

2.  Can you give an example of how to compare that data.  For example would you use the 
absolute terms or would you use the percentages? 

The Census Bureau recommends the use of percents when making comparisons because the ACS 
is designed to produce estimates of distributions or "percent" estimates.  Estimates of counts, for 
example the total number of people in poverty, may also be used.  However, the Population 
Estimates Program produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the 
nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.  
Users should be careful with the interpretation of percent change as these reflect the growth or 
decline in estimates of counts.  Comparisons of ACS estimates are based on statistical tests of 
significance.  For an example, see response to question #4.

3.  If you are standing by the use of the C2SS in comparisons of children in poverty from 

2000 - 2006, how do I explain to policy makers that a survey from 6 counties is 
comparable to a survey from the entire state in 2006 - which includes more areas that 
are in poverty. 

The C2SS county sample (see technical note below) was a probability sample and as such was a 
representative sample for Colorado.  That is, the C2SS was designed to produce national and 
state level estimates.  However, estimates from the C2SS sample are subject to larger margins of 
error than estimates from the current ACS sample. To compare C2SS estimates to estimates from 
the 2005 ACS and beyond users need to consider the margins of error. 

C2SS Sample Design Technical Note - As part of the C2SS sample selection system some 
counties were selected in sample with certainty.  These were primarily large counties such as Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, and Cooke County.  Direct estimation was possible for these counties. 
Other smaller counties were grouped in sets of 2 or 3 (technically known as PSU's - primary 
sampling units) prior to sample selection and a probability sample of these areas (or PSU's) was 
selected.  As a result, county level estimates were available for a small subset of counties only. 
This kind of design supports estimation for states and the nation.  Direct estimates for large 
counties selected in sample with certainty were also possible.  A major drawback of the C2SS 
sample selection system was that the survey estimates were subject to larger variances.  This is 
an important consideration that users need to take into account as explained before. 

4.  How do you best compare estimates with margins of error over time.  An example 

would be great. 

Comparison of estimates should be based on a statistical test of significance.  This approach will 
allow users to assess whether the observed difference is likely due to chance (and thus is not 
statistically significant) or if it represents a true difference (and thus is statistically significant). 

Algebraically, the significance test can be expressed as follows: 

ˆ
X

If 

, then the difference between estimates 

ˆX

1

 and 

ˆX

2

 is statistically 

significant at the specified confidence level, CL 

iXˆ

where 

 is an annual estimate.  

iSE  is the corresponding standard error (SE) for the estimate. 
CLZ  is the critical value for the desired confidence level (1.645 for 90 percent, 1.960 for 95 

percent, and 2.576 for 99 percent). 

Most ACS data products show the estimates and their associated margins of error (MOE).  So 
when using ACS data, the SE is calculated by taking the positive value of the MOE and dividing 
by 1.645 (for years prior to 2006, use 1.65).

Example: 

A data user wants to determine if the difference in the observed estimated percent of children 
under 18 years living in poverty in 2006 (22.0 percent, MOE=+/-0.20) and in 2007 (21.5 percent, 
MOE=+/-0.20) is statistically different at the 99 percent confidence level. 

First, determine the SE for each estimate: 

SE1= 0.20   =0.12 
1.645 

and   SE2= 0.20   =0.12 

1.645 

Then, calculate the test value using the formula above:

Since the test value (2.90) is greater than the critical value for a confidence level of 99 percent 
(2.576), the difference in the percentages is statistically significant at a 99-percent confidence 
level. A rough interpretation of the result is the user can be 99 percent certain that a change in the 
percent of children under 18 years living in poverty took place in 2007.  

By contrast, if the corresponding estimates for 2006 and 2007 were 22.1 and 22.5, respectively, 
with margins of error of +/-0.33 (SE=0.20) and +/-0.41(SE=0.25), respectively, the formula 
would yield

Since the test value (1.25) is less than the critical value for a confidence level of 99 percent 
(2.576), we can't conclude there was a change.

5. The margins of error are quite large when using the C2SS data to compare to the ACS 
2006 at a state level.  At what point do you say that the margin of error is too large and it is 
therefore better to use the Census 2000?  How do you balance margin of error with 
potential survey difference error?  If you recommend using the Census 2000 for county 
data comparisons to the ACS 2006 why wouldn't the survey difference error be even 
smaller at a state level with a large sample? 

Recommendations are based on judgment. There’s no magic number. The two main factors that 
go into a recommendation on what survey to use to look at a time series are consistency in the 
methods used to produce the estimates and sampling error. To isolate real change (versus a 
change in measurement) it is always wise to compare estimates based on consistent methods.  
The CPS methods have been very consistent over time, but standard errors are large. C2SS/ACS 
comparisons are generally consistent and we think the standard errors, at the state level, are 
acceptable even in smaller states. Census 2000/ACS comparisons have, as you point out, lower 
levels of sampling error, but any cross-survey comparison brings risk with it, and at the state 
level, our judgment was that the cross-survey risk outweighed the benefits of lower standard 
errors. 

That is not to say that other analysts could examine the same numbers we have examined and 
come up with a different recommendation, or that it is wrong for a user to use CPS or Census 
2000/ACS data to examine state trends. We are merely saying that if a reporter calls the Census 
Bureau and asks whether poverty has changed in Colorado since 2000, our first response will be 
to use the C2SS and ACS data to answer that basic question.  

6. Do you recommend using the C2SS data for race/ethnicity poverty comparisons at the 
state level? 

We haven’t done much analysis of this, but in the absence of a detailed analysis, we’d 
recommend using Census 2000/ACS to look at state poverty trends by race/ethnicity.  This 
would be largely driven by reliability concerns.  This is particularly the case for the smaller race 
groups, such as Native Hawaiians and American Indians and Alaskan Natives.     

7. Will you be recommending that users use the C2SS to compare to the ACS through 
2010? 

Yes, unless further research points to systematic problems associated with C2SS/ACS poverty 
comparisons that would lead us to change our recommendation.

8. Why hasn't Census produced information on the website that discusses how to compare 
ACS over time to the C2SS?  The majority of your information discusses how to compare 
2007 to 2006 to 2005 to Census 2000. 

There are many conceptual issues associated with making Census 2000/ACS comparisons. 
Knowing that users are going to make comparisons between Census 2000 and the ACS, the 
Census Bureau was obligated to provide users with as much detailed assistance as we could in 
order to help users interpret trends.  

There are fewer conceptual issues to worry about when making C2SS/ACS comparisons, though 
we have noted that, in the case of poverty, the inclusion of group quarters in the ACS universe 
makes comparisons more complicated. There is a working paper that will soon be posted on the 
Census Bureau website that will provide more information to users on the impact of the inclusion 
of group quarters into the poverty estimates.  

9. How important is it to use the margins of error when comparing estimates?   

Very important, which is why the Census Bureau always publishes margins of error when 
disseminating ACS tables, and every statement in a Census Bureau report, press release, or 
research paper is tested for statistical significance. However, other factors come into play as 
well, and survey consistency is one of those issues. 

10. Do you recommend using SAIPE data for county comparisons overtime - taking into 
account the break in the time series?  In Colorado most of the counties are not part of the 
annual ACS data.  A few more will be part of the three-year average.  Do you think SAIPE 
will be better or worse than a three-year or 5-year moving average? 

As you probably know, SAIPE data are the only source of county poverty data for every county 
in the U.S. that are more up-to-date than Census 2000 data. So for a user who requires up-to-date 
data for every county, regardless of population size, SAIPE data are a valuable source of 
information. The data can be used to look at trends, though, as you point out, there is a break in 
the time series.  

At this point we really don’t have a basis to compare SAIPE estimates to 3-year or 5-year 
moving averages, though as you know the 3-year ACS estimates will be released this December. 
We realize that this will be an important user issue down the road, and the Census Bureau will 
spend considerable resources researching this issue in order to provide guidance to users.

1/A 90-percent confidence interval is a measure of an estimate's variability.  The larger the confidence interval in 
relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate.  Fore more information see "Standard errors and their 
use" at http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/p60_235sa.pdf.
