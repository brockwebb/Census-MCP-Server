Disability, Employment, and
Benefit Receipt: 2021

April 2025
Written by: Zachary Scherer and Clayton Gumber
Report Number: P70-203

Introduction

According to estimates from the 2022 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), over 30 million American

adults aged 18 to 64 were living with a disability. For some of these individuals, the nature or severity of their disability

could affect employment and other economic outcomes. Several social safety net programs and other income

sources exist to support individuals whose health or disability limit their potential employment, but eligibility

requirements for such programs vary. Perhaps as a result, adults with a disability have lower income than their

counterparts without disability. This report uses data from the 2022 SIPP to examine the intersection between
disability status, employment, and participation in a variety of social support programs in order to better understand
this gap in income between individuals with and without a disability.
