We ask questions about a person's employer, the kind of

business or industry of that employer, the kind of work a person

does, and that person's most important activities to produce

industry, occupation, and class of worker statistics.

These data help provide information about the labor force in

government programs; evaluate government programs and

policies to ensure they fairly and equitably serve the needs of

all groups; and enforce laws, regulations, and policies against

discrimination in society.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci

and law enforcement.

Questions as they appear on the form

We ask six questions about a person's occupation, industry, and employer to create a proﬁle of
the nation's labor force.

Industry, occupation, and class of worker data help communities:

Provide Employment Opportunities

Employers, federal agencies, and federal government contractors are interested in knowing whether programs designed to emp

speciﬁc groups, such as people with disabilities or veterans, are succeeding (Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance A

Rehabilitation Act of 1973). Industry, occupation, and class of worker data provide additional detail about the jobs and careers

pursued by people participating in these programs.

State and local agencies use these statistics to:

Identify labor surplus areas (areas with people available for hiring and training).
Plan workforce development programs including job fairs and training programs.
Promote business opportunities.

Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity

We want to know more about people who are employed or looking for work in combination with educational attainment, age, sex

race, Hispanic origin, disability status, veteran status, and other data, to help governments and communities enforce civil rights
laws against employment discrimination (Civil Rights Act of 1964). For example, these data help enforce nondiscrimination in

employment by federal agencies, private employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations.

Understand Changes

Information on growing or declining industries and occupations help estimate changes in the economy. Labor force estimates are

used in funding decisions; to ensure surveys are accurate, including surveys that provide ofﬁcial labor market estimates; and to
understand changes in other data (Wagner-Peyser Act and Workforce Investment Act).

The National Institute of Food and Agriculture use class of worker data to understand changes in farm workers and agriculture.

History of industry, occupation, class of worker questions

Industry questions originated with the 1820 Census, occupation questions originated with the 1850 Census, and class of worker

questions originated with the 1910 Census. They were transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the decennial census lon
form.

In 2019, modiﬁcations were made to the questions about the industry, occupation, and class of worker questions. Research abo

this modiﬁcation for the industry, occupation [https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2017/acs/2017_Martinez_02.html] ,
and class of worker [https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2017/acs/2017_Martinez_01.html] questions and copies of

previous questionnaires [https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaire-archive.2018.html] are
available on the ACS website.
