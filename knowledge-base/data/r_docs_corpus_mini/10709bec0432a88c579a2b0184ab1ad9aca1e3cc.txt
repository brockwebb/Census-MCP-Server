Understanding and Using
American Community
Survey Data: What the
Business Community
Needs to Know

October 2020

Suppose a restaurant owner wants

to determine the best location to

start a new franchise. Managers at

an engineering firm want to expand
their business but need more
information about the local

workforce. A clothing retailer needs
information about potential
customers before opening a new
store, distribution center, or
warehouse. Where can businesses
find the data they need to make
informed decisions?

The U.S. Census Bureau’s American
Community Survey (ACS) provides
corporations, small businesses, and

individuals the detailed social,
economic, housing, and
demographic data they need to
gauge the sales potential of
products and services, better
understand the workforce, and set
strategies for growth.

This guide provides a brief overview
of how businesses are using ACS
data to stay competitive, run
efficiently, and meet customers’
needs.
