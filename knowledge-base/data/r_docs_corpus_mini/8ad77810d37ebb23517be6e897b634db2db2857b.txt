We ask questions about the presence of hot and cold running

water, a bathtub or shower, a sink with a faucet, a stove or

range, a refrigerator, connectivity to a public sewer, telephone

service, and presence of solar panels to create data about

indicators of housing quality.

Local, state, tribal, and federal agencies use these data to plan

and fund programs for housing assistance, rehabilitation loans,

and other programs that help people access and afford decent,

safe, and sanitary housing. Public health ofﬁcials also use this

information to locate areas in danger of groundwater

contamination and waterborne diseases.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci
and law enforcement.

Questions as they appear on the form

We ask four questions that cover information on plumbing and kitchen facilities, public sewer,
telephone service, and solar panels to better understand housing quality and infrastructure
needs.

Results from these questions

We compile the results from these questions to provide communities with important statistics to help in their housing assistance

planning. You can see some of these published statistics here for the nation, states, and your community. Data for public sewer
and solar panels are planned to be released starting in 2026.

Plumbing facilities, kitchen facilities, telephone service, and solar panel data help communities:

Provide Adequate Housing

We ask about the quality of housing in a community to understand whether available housing meets the needs of residents. Whe

housing is not sufﬁcient or not affordable, data on household facilities helps communities:

Enroll eligible households in programs designed to assist them.
Qualify for grants from the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnership Program, Emergency Solutions

Grants (ESG), Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA), and other programs.

Plan Community Development

We ask about the quality of homes and whether they are occupied or vacant, which helps communities identify opportunities to:

Improve tax, assistance, and zoning policies.
Reduce tax revenue losses from vacant or abandoned properties.
Target emergency planning and preparation in disaster-prone areas.

Ensure Residents Can Communicate

We measure the extent of telephone service to help communities ensure their residents have universal access to assistance
programs, emergency services, and important information.

Measure Environmental Impacts

Substandard plumbing systems may impact the local water supply. We ask about these systems to help communities research
their infrastructure needs and work to improve their systems.

Anticipate Future Energy Needs

Information about using solar panels to generate electricity helps to match energy consumption to energy production across the
United States.

History of plumbing facilities, kitchen facilities, telephone service, and solar panel questions

Plumbing facilities and kitchen facilities originated with the 1940 Census, while telephone service originated with the 1960 Censu

They were transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the decennial census long form. The telephone service question was
added to the ACS in 2008. The telephone question was then modiﬁed in 2019. Research about this modiﬁcation

[https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2017/acs/2017_Mazur_01.html] and copies of previous questionnaires

[https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaire-archive.2018.html] are available on the ACS website
The public sewer question originated with the 1960 Census and was discontinued after the 1990 Census. The current question

was added to the ACS in 2025. The solar panel question was also added to the ACS in 2025.
