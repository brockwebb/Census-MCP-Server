Provide Health Care to Children and Families

We ask about the numbers of women with a recent birth in

combination with other information, such as marital status,

labor force status, household income, health insurance status,

and poverty status, to help communities understand changes in

the demand for health care. For example, communities, tribes,

and the federal government use statistics on how many

American Indian babies are born to estimate the demand for

health care through the Indian Health Service.

Understand Changing Households

We ask about the characteristics of women who are giving

birth, including where they live, to understand potential impacts

on housing, public health, and pollution.

Though local vital statistics ofﬁces typically have a count of

births per year, along with some characteristics of the parents,

fertility data provide federal program planners, policymakers,
and researchers a more complete picture of families. This is

because we collect additional statistics about the age,
education, and employment of parents in households

welcoming children, and other important information about the
homes (age, size, etc.) and households (poverty level,

language spoken, and living arrangements, etc.).

State and local agencies use these statistics in combination
with other information about new mothers, such as education

and income, to understand future needs for the local education
system and health services.

History of fertility question

The decennial census began asking about fertility in 1940. The ACS fertility question was added in 2005 when the ACS replaced

the decennial census long form.
