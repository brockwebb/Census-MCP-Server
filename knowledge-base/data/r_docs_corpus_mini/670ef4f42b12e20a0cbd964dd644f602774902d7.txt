We ask questions about whether a person is currently married,

widowed, divorced, separated, or never married; whether

his/her marital status changed in the past 12 months; and

lifetime marriages to create statistics about current marital

status and marital history.

Marital status and marital history data help federal agencies

understand marriage trends, forecast future needs of programs

that have spousal beneﬁts, and measure the effects of policies

and programs that focus on the well-being of families, including

tax policies and ﬁnancial assistance programs.

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci
and law enforcement.

Questions as they appear on the form

We ask four questions that cover information about marital status, changes in marital status, and
lifetime marital history.

Marital status/marital history data help communities:

Provide Benefits to Spouses and Survivors

We ask about how many times you have been married to help

federal agencies plan and fund programs with spousal beneﬁts,

including veteran and social security programs, and help

communities determine where gaps in beneﬁts and services

might exist.

Provide Assistance to Families

We want to know about families, particularly blended and

single-parent families, along with data about the presence of
children, labor force status, and poverty status, to help

communities:

Enroll eligible families in programs designed to assist them, such

as the Children's Health Insurance Program.
Qualify for grants to fund these programs.
Evaluate programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families

(TANF).

Understand Changing Households

We ask about marital status to help us understand marriage
trends (whether people are marrying later in life, not getting

married, or marrying again), in combination with information
about age, presence of children, income, etc., to help

communities understand if the available housing, job training,
rental assistance, and administrative services and programs

are meeting residents' needs during their major life changes.
These data also help the federal government plan for the

future. For example, the Social Security Administration
estimates future program needs based on the current

relationships of working people.

History of marital questions

Marital status originated with the 1880 Census, while marital history originated with the 1850 Census. Marital status was

transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the decennial census long form, while marital history was added in 2008.
