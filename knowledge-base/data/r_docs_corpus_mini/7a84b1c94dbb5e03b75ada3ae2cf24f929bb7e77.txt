Vintage of Geographic Areas for ACS Estimates

The ACS typically publishes estimates using the latest available geographic boundaries (also known as "vintages").

For ACS 5-year estimates, use the last year of the estimate period to determine the vintage. For example, the following

datasets use the same vintages of geographic boundaries:

2023 ACS 1-year estimates

2019-2023 ACS 5-year estimates

To learn more about geographic concepts used in the ACS, check out our geographic handbook Geography and the
American Community Survey: What Data Users Need to Know [/programs-

For statistical areas, boundary changes are mostly associated with updates from each decennial census. Statistical

areas are designed to have stable boundaries over time.

While the American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the Office of Management and

Budget (OMB) definitions of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas; in certain instances the

names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB
definitions due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.

**Changes to the boundaries of legal areas may cause complementary changes to the boundaries of

selected statistical areas.
