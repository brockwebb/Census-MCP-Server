We ask questions about whether a person worked last week

and, if the answer is no, why he or she was not working. For

those who were not working, we also ask whether he or she

plans to return to work, and when they last worked.

These data are used in planning and funding government

programs that provide unemployment assistance and services.

These data also help evaluate other government programs and

policies to ensure they fairly and equitably serve the needs of

all groups, as well as enforce laws, regulations, and policies

against discrimination in society.

Your privacy concerns

We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables that contain all th

data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The Census Bureau is legally bound to

strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcemen

entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agenci

and law enforcement.

Employment status data help communities:

Provide Employment Opportunities

Employers, federal agencies, and federal government contractors are interested in knowing whether programs designed to emp

speciﬁc groups, such as people with disabilities or veterans, are succeeding (Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance A

Rehabilitation Act of 1973).

State and local agencies use these statistics to:

Identify labor surplus areas (areas with people available for hiring and training).
Plan workforce development programs, including job fairs and training programs.
Promote business opportunities.

Ensure Equal Opportunity

We want to know more about people who are employed or looking for work in combination with age, sex, race, Hispanic origin,

disability status, veteran status, and other data, to help governments and communities enforce laws, regulations, and policies

against discrimination in employment. For example, labor force data are used to enforce nondiscrimination in employment by
federal agencies, private employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations (Civil Rights Act of 1964).

Understand Changes

Information on the characteristics of people who are working or looking for work is an important part of estimating changes in the
economy. Labor force estimates are used in funding decisions; to ensure surveys are accurate, including surveys that provide

ofﬁcial labor market estimates; and to understand change in other data (Wagner-Peyser Act and Workforce Investment Act).

History of employment status questions

Labor force status questions originated with the 1890 Census. It was transferred to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the

decennial census long form.
