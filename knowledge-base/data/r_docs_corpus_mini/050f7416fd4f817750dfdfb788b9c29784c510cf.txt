Vintage of Geographic Areas for ACS Estimates

The ACS typically publishes estimates using the latest available geographic boundaries (also known as "vintages").

For ACS 5-year estimates, use the last year of the estimate period to determine the vintage. For example, the following

datasets use the same vintages of geographic boundaries:

2023 ACS 1-year estimates

2019-2023 ACS 5-year estimates

To learn more about geographic concepts used in the ACS, check out our geographic handbook Geography and the
American Community Survey: What Data Users Need to Know [/programs-

including: the Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS) [/programs-surveys/bas.html] , the Redistricting Data Program
[/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo.html]  and the School District Review Program [/programs-

areas are designed to have stable boundaries over time.

Changes to the boundaries of legal areas may cause complementary changes to the boundaries of

selected statistical areas.

While the American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the Office of Management and

Budget (OMB) definitions of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas; in certain instances the

names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB
definitions due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.

The Census Bureau is planning on publishing the updated boundaries for this geographic summary level with the 2023 ACS

release.
