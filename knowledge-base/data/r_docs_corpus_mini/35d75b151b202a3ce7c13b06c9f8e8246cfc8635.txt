The Emergency and
Transitional Shelter
Population: 2020

October 31, 2024
Report Number: C2020SR-01
Written by: William Koerber, Erik Schmidt, and Steven Wilson

Introduction

This report is the third by the U.S. Census Bureau focusing on the population in emergency and transitional shelters
and their demographic characteristics.  Special reports were written after the 2000 and 2010 Censuses were

conducted.  The 2020 report is formatted similarly to the 2010 report for easier comparison. According to the 2020

Census, there were 188,889 people in emergency and transitional shelters in the United States. This amounted to 2.3

percent of the 8.2 million people counted in group quarters (GQs) in the 2020 Census.

Emergency and transitional shelter data were collected as part of service-based enumeration (SBE) during the 2020
Census Group Quarters operations. The 2020 SBE provided an opportunity for people without conventional housing or
people experiencing homelessness to be included in the census by enumerating them at places where they received

services or at preidentified outdoor locations. In addition to emergency and transitional shelters, people were
enumerated at soup kitchens, regularly scheduled food vans, and targeted nonsheltered outdoor locations (e.g.,
people staying outside in certain preidentified places like encampments under bridges or in parking lots).
