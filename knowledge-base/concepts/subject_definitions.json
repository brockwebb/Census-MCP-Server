Scope: These definitions apply to the data collected in both the United States and Puerto Rico. The text specifically notes any differences. References about comparability to the previous ACS years refer only to the ACS in the United States. Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters was included in the data tabulations. Historical Census Comparability: For additional information about the data in previous decennial censuses, see https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html. Why We Ask: For additional information about the Federal Uses and why we ask specific questions, see https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/operations-and-administration/2014-content- review/federal-uses.html. Weighting Methodology: The weighting methodology in the 2006 ACS was modified in order to ensure consistent estimates of occupied housing units, households, and householders. For more information on the 2006 weighting methodology changes, see the user note titled “Modification Made in 2006 ACS Weighting Methodology-Family Equalization” on the ACS website (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user- notes/2006-03.html). There were no significant changes to the 2007 or 2008 weighting methodology. Beginning in 2009, the weighting methodology has changed to include the use of controls for total population for incorporated places and minor civil divisions. For subject definitions from previous years, visit http://www.census.gov and search for “ACS Code Lists, Definitions, and Accuracy.” Living Quarters Living quarters are classified as either housing units or group quarters. Living quarters are usually found in structures intended for residential use, but also may be found in structures intended for nonresidential use as well as in places such as tents, vans, and emergency and transitional shelters. Housing Unit A housing unit may be a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms or a single room that is occupied (or, if vacant, intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to the intended occupants whenever possible. If that information cannot be obtained, the criteria are applied to the previous occupants. Both occupied and vacant housing units are included in the housing unit inventory. Boats, recreational vehicles (RVs), vans, tents, railroad cars, and the like are included only if they are occupied as someone's current place of residence. Vacant mobile homes are included provided they are intended for occupancy on the site where they stand. Vacant mobile homes on dealers' sales lots, at the factory, or in storage yards are excluded from the housing inventory. Also excluded from the housing inventory are quarters being used entirely for nonresidential purposes, such as a store or an office, or quarters used for the storage of business supplies or inventory, machinery, or agricultural products. Occupied Housing Unit – A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the current place of residence of the person or group of people living in it at the time of interview, or if the occupants are only temporarily absent from the residence for two months or less, that is, away on vacation or a business trip. If all the people staying in the unit at the time of the interview are staying there for two months or less, the unit is considered to be temporarily occupied and classified as “vacant.” The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living quarters. The living quarters occupied by staff personnel within any group quarters are separate housing units if they satisfy the housing unit criteria of separateness and direct access; otherwise, they are considered group quarters. Occupied rooms or suites of rooms in hotels, motels, and similar places are classified as housing units only when occupied by permanent residents, that is, people who consider the hotel as their current place of residence or have no current place of residence elsewhere. If any of the occupants in rooming or boarding houses, congregate housing, or continuing care facilities live separately from others in the building and have direct access, their quarters are classified as separate housing units. Vacant Housing Unit – A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of interview. Units occupied at the time of interview entirely by persons who are staying two months or less and who have a more permanent residence elsewhere are considered to be temporarily occupied, and are classified as “vacant.” New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place. Vacant units are excluded from the housing inventory if they are open to the elements, that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished. Comparability –The ACS estimates of occupied housing units and vacant housing units differ from those obtained from the 2020 Census. For more information on why estimates for this topic may differ between the ACS and decennial census, see “Comparing 2010 ACS & 2010 Census Occupancy, Vacancy, & Household Size” on the Census website. Group Quarters A Group Quarters (GQ) is a place where people live or stay in a group living arrangement that is owned or managed by an entity or organization providing housing and/or services for the residents. These services may include custodial or medical care, as well as other types of assistance, and residency is commonly restricted to those receiving these services. This is not a typical household-type living arrangement. People living in GQs usually are not related to each other. GQs include such places as college residence halls, residential treatment centers, skilled nursing facilities, group homes, military barracks, correctional facilities, workers’ dormitories, and facilities for people experiencing homelessness. GQs are defined according to the housing and/or services provided to residents and are identified by Census GQ type codes. In January 2006, the American Community Survey (ACS) was expanded to include the population living in GQ facilities. The ACS GQ sample encompasses 12 independent samples; like the housing unit (HU) sample, a new GQ sample is introduced each month. The GQ data collection lasts only 6 weeks and does not include a formal nonresponse follow- up operation. The GQ data collection operation is conducted in two phases. First, U.S. Census Bureau Field Representatives (FRs) conduct interviews with the GQ facility contact person or administrator of the selected GQ (GQ level), and second, the FR conducts interviews with a sample of individuals from the facility (person level). The GQ-level data collection instrument is an automated Group Quarters Facility Questionnaire (GQFQ). Information collected by the FR using the GQFQ during the GQ- level interview is used to determine or verify the type of facility, population size, and the sample of individuals to be interviewed. FRs conduct GQ-level data collection at approximately 20,000 individual GQ facilities each year.",

A list of the GQ facilities (and their respective type codes) that are in scope for the 2023 ACS can be found in the 2023 Code List on the ACS website. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Code Lists, Definitions, and Accuracy” in the search box. Question/Concept History – Though the ACS was expanded to include the population living in GQ facilities in 2006, the ACS began field testing early. The pretest in 2001 allowed the ACS to determine whether or not the new processes, type codes, and procedures would produce the desired outcome for the 2006 ACS GQ data collection operation. In 2001, the ACS GQ operational staff and other ACS staff implemented a number of changes in the GQ operation, the greatest of which was developing an automated Group Quarters Facility Questionnaire (GQFQ). The staff developed the GQFQ based on the decennial Other Living Quarters (OLQ) questionnaire used in the 2004 Census test. However, in order to make that questionnaire script fit with the ACS operation, the developers made some modifications, such as dropping the listing component and adding the ability to capture multiple GQ types within the GQ sampled. Along with the introduction of an automated GQFQ, the ACS made the decision to use the revised GQ definitions planned for the 2010 Census, even though the definitions of GQ types were still evolving. The pretest used a draft version of the GQ definitions that existed at the end of November 2004. Since these definitions will continue to evolve over the next several years, the ACS needed a GQFQ that could easily adopt future revisions to the definitions. Thus, the developers designed a flexible GQFQ. It was through this flexibility that group quarter types have been able to be added or dropped (e.g. YMCA/YWCA and hostels). Comparability – The total group quarters population in the ACS may not be comparable with the 2010 or 2020 Censuses because there are some 2010 and 2020 Census GQ types that were out of scope in the ACS. These include soup kitchens, regularly scheduled mobile food vans, targeted non-sheltered outdoor locations, crews of maritime vessels, and living quarters for victims of natural disasters. The exclusion of these GQ types from the ACS may result in a small bias in some ACS estimates to the extent that the excluded population is different from the included population. Furthermore, only a sample of GQ facilities throughout the United States and Puerto Rico are selected for the ACS. ACS controls the GQ sample at the state level only. Therefore, for lower levels of geography, particularly when there are relatively few GQs in a geographic area, the ACS estimate of the GQ population may vary from the count from the 2010 and 2020 Censuses. When comparing the 2023 ACS data with previous ACS data, the data should be compared with caution at the National and State levels. It should not be compared below the State level because the weighting for the group quarters (GQ) population is not controlled below the state level. Because of this, users may observe greater fluctuations in year-to-year ACS estimates of the GQ population at sub-state levels than at state levels. The causes of these fluctuations typically are the result of either GQs that have closed or where the current population of the GQ is significantly different than the expected population as reflected on",

The causes of these fluctuations typically are the result of either GQs that have closed or where the current population of the GQ is significantly different than the expected population as reflected on the sampling frame. Substantial changes in the ACS GQ estimates can impact ACS estimates of total population characteristics for areas where either the GQ population is a substantial proportion of the total population or where the GQ population may have very different characteristics than the total population as a whole. Users can assess the impact that year-to- year changes in sub-state GQ total population estimates have on the changes in total ACS population estimates by accessing Table B26001. Go to https://data.census.gov/ and enter the table number. Users should also use their local knowledge to help determine whether the year-to-year change in the ACS estimate represents a real change in the GQ population or may be the result of the lack of adequate population controls for sub-state areas. must be noted that beginning in 2008 military transient quarters, YMCA/YWCA and hostels were no longer in scope. These data were collected in 2006 and 2007. Since the 2011 ACS, the GQ population has been supplemented using whole person imputation into not-in-sample GQ facilities. This increased the reliability of substate estimates for the total GQ population and characteristics of the residence population. State- level estimates were relatively unchanged by the new methodology. Housing Variables Acreage (Cuerda) The data on acreage were obtained from Housing Question 4 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). This question was asked at occupied and vacant one-family houses and mobile homes. The data for vacant units were obtained by asking a neighbor, real estate agent, building manager, or anyone else who had knowledge of the vacant unit in question. This question determines a range of acres (cuerdas) on which the house or mobile home is located. A major purpose for this question, in conjunction with Housing Question 5 on agricultural sales, is to identify farm units. In previous ACS questionnaires and in Census 2000, this question was used to determine single-family homes on 10 or more acres (cuerdas). The land may consist of more than one tract or plot. These tracts or plots are usually adjoining; however, they may be separated by a road, creek, another piece of land, etc. In the ACS prior to 2004 and in Census 2000, acreage was one of the variables used to determine specified owner- and renter-occupied housing units. Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 question asked, “Is this house or mobile home on less than 1 acre, 1 to less than 10 acres, or 10 or more acres.” Since 1999, the question wording was changed to ask, “How many acres is this house or mobile home on?” and the second response category was modified to “1 to 9.9 acres.” (In the Puerto Rico Community Survey, the question wording was changed to ask about cuerdas instead of acres.) Comparability – Data on acreage in the 2023 ACS can be compared to previous ACS and Census 2000 acreage data. Agricultural Sales Data on the sales of agricultural crops were obtained from Housing Question 5 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at occupied one-family houses and mobile homes located on lots of 1 or more acres (cuerdas). Data for this question exclude units on lots of less than 1 acre (cuerda), units located in structures containing two or more units, and all vacant units. This question refers to the total amount (before taxes and expenses) received in the 12 months prior to the interview from the sale of crops, vegetables, fruits, nuts, livestock and livestock products, and nursery and forest products produced on “this property.” Respondents new to a unit were to estimate total agricultural sales from the 12 months prior to the interview, even if some portion of the sales had been made by previous occupants of the unit. This question is used mainly to classify housing units as farm or nonfarm residences, not to provide detailed information on the sale of agricultural products. Detailed information on the sale of agricultural products is provided by the Census of Agriculture, which is conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture/National Agricultural Statistics Service (see http://www.agcensus.usda.gov). Question/Concept History – On the 1996-1998 ACS questionnaires, there were just two response categories to indicate whether or not the amount of sales was over $1,000. Since 1999, the question has included a series of response categories for the amount of the agricultural sales. Comparability – Data on agricultural sales in the 2023 ACS can be compared to previous ACS and Census 2000 agricultural sales data. Bedrooms The data on bedrooms were obtained from Housing Question 6b in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. The number of bedrooms is the count of rooms designed to be used as bedrooms, that is, the number of rooms that would be listed as bedrooms if the house, apartment, or mobile home were on the market for sale or for rent. Included are all rooms intended to be used as bedrooms even if they currently are being used for some other purpose. A housing unit consisting of only one room is classified, by definition, as having no bedroom. Bedrooms provide the basis for estimating the amount of living and sleeping spaces within a housing unit. These data allow officials to evaluate the adequacy of the housing stock to shelter the population and to determine any housing deficiencies in neighborhoods. The data also allow officials to track the changing physical characteristics of the housing inventory over time. Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided a response category for “None” and space for the respondent to enter a number of bedrooms. From 1999-2007, the question provided pre-coded response categories from “No bedroom” to “5 or more bedrooms.” Starting in 2008, the question became the second part of a two-part question that linked the number of “rooms” and number of “bedrooms” questions together. In addition, the wording of the question was changed to ask, “How many of these rooms are bedrooms?” Additional changes introduced in 2008 included removing the pre-coded response categories and adding a write-in box for the respondent to enter the number of bedrooms, providing the rule to use for defining a “bedroom” as an instruction, and providing an additional instruction addressing efficiency and studio apartments - “If this is an efficiency/studio apartment, print ‘0’.” Limitation of the Data – The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the bedrooms question in the 2006 ACS Content Test.

This question refers to the total amount (before taxes and expenses) received in the 12 months prior to the interview from the sale of crops, vegetables, fruits, nuts, livestock and livestock products, and nursery and forest products produced on “this property.” Respondents new to a unit were to estimate total agricultural sales from the 12 months prior to the interview, even if some portion of the sales had been made by previous occupants of the unit. This question is used mainly to classify housing units as farm or nonfarm residences, not to provide detailed information on the sale of agricultural products. Detailed information on the sale of agricultural products is provided by the Census of Agriculture, which is conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture/National Agricultural Statistics Service (see http://www.agcensus.usda.gov). Question/Concept History – On the 1996-1998 ACS questionnaires, there were just two response categories to indicate whether or not the amount of sales was over $1,000. Since 1999, the question has included a series of response categories for the amount of the agricultural sales. Comparability – Data on agricultural sales in the 2023 ACS can be compared to previous ACS and Census 2000 agricultural sales data. Bedrooms The data on bedrooms were obtained from Housing Question 6b in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. The number of bedrooms is the count of rooms designed to be used as bedrooms, that is, the number of rooms that would be listed as bedrooms if the house, apartment, or mobile home were on the market for sale or for rent. Included are all rooms intended to be used as bedrooms even if they currently are being used for some other purpose. A housing unit consisting of only one room is classified, by definition, as having no bedroom. Bedrooms provide the basis for estimating the amount of living and sleeping spaces within a housing unit. These data allow officials to evaluate the adequacy of the housing stock to shelter the population and to determine any housing deficiencies in neighborhoods. The data also allow officials to track the changing physical characteristics of the housing inventory over time. Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided a response category for “None” and space for the respondent to enter a number of bedrooms. From 1999-2007, the question provided pre-coded response categories from “No bedroom” to “5 or more bedrooms.” Starting in 2008, the question became the second part of a two-part question that linked the number of “rooms” and number of “bedrooms” questions together. In addition, the wording of the question was changed to ask, “How many of these rooms are bedrooms?” Additional changes introduced in 2008 included removing the pre-coded response categories and adding a write-in box for the respondent to enter the number of bedrooms, providing the rule to use for defining a “bedroom” as an instruction, and providing an additional instruction addressing efficiency and studio apartments - “If this is an efficiency/studio apartment, print ‘0’.” Limitation of the Data – The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the bedrooms question in the 2006 ACS Content Test.

      "definition": "The data on acreage were obtained from Housing Question 4 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). This question was asked at occupied and vacant one-family houses and mobile homes. The data for vacant units were obtained by asking a neighbor, real estate agent, building manager, or anyone else who had knowledge of the vacant unit in question. This question determines a range of acres (cuerdas) on which the house or mobile home is located. A major purpose for this question, in conjunction with Housing Question 5 on agricultural sales, is to identify farm units. In previous ACS questionnaires and in Census 2000, this question was used to determine single-family homes on 10 or more acres (cuerdas). The land may consist of more than one tract or plot. These tracts or plots are usually adjoining; however, they may be separated by a road, creek, another piece of land, etc. In the ACS prior to 2004 and in Census 2000, acreage was one of the variables used to determine specified owner- and renter-occupied housing units. Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 question asked, “Is this house or mobile home on less than 1 acre, 1 to less than 10 acres, or 10 or more acres.” Since 1999, the question wording was changed to ask, “How many acres is this house or mobile home on?” and the second response category was modified to “1 to 9.9 acres.” (In the Puerto Rico Community Survey, the question wording was changed to ask about cuerdas instead of acres.)

Changes made to the bedrooms question between the 2007 and 2008 ACS involving the wording as well as the response option resulted in an inconsistency in the ACS data. This inconsistency in the data was most noticeable as an increase in “No bedroom” responses and as a decrease in “1 bedroom” to “3 bedrooms” responses. Computer and Internet Use The 2008 Broadband Improvement Act mandated the collection of data about computer and internet use. As a result, three questions were added to the 2013 American Community Survey (ACS) to measure these topics. Data about computer and internet use were derived from answers to Question 9, Question 10 and Question 11 on the 2023 ACS, and are asked of all occupied housing units. The computer use question (Question 9) asked if anyone in the household owned or used a computer and included four response categories for a desktop or laptop, a smartphone, a tablet or other portable wireless computer, and some other type of computer. Respondents selected a checkbox for “Yes” or “No” for each response category. Respondents could select all categories that applied. Respondents who checked “Yes” for the “some other type of computer” category are asked to write in descriptions of their other computer type(s). These are mostly used for internal purposes and to verify whether the household has some other type of computer, although some people may write in a type of computer that can be reclassified as a desktop or laptop, a smartphone, or a tablet or other portable wireless computer. Question 10 asked if any member of the household has access to the internet. “Access” refers to whether or not someone in the household uses or can connect to the internet, regardless of whether or not they pay for the service. Respondents were to select only ONE of the following choices: Yes, by paying a cell phone company or Internet service provider – This category includes housing units where someone pays to access the internet through a service such as a data plan for a smartphone; a broadband internet service such as cable, fiber optic or DSL; satellite; dial-up; or other type of service.

Limitation of the Data – These questions are not asked for the group quarters population, so do not include data about people living in housing such as dorms, prisons, nursing homes, etc. Comparability – Data prior to 2013 are not available because 2013 was the first year that these questions were collected using the ACS. For more information, go to http://www.census.gov and enter “Comparing ACS Data” in the search box. Caution should be used when comparing pre-2016 estimates due to question revisions. Observed changes may be due to the revised wording used in the questions and improved measurement rather than a change in use. For more information, go to the search box. The Current Population Survey (CPS) has periodically collected data about computer use since 1984 and about internet use since 1997. Both surveys exclude those living in group quarters. However, users should note CPS data are not necessarily comparable to ACS data in several important ways. First, unlike the ACS, some CPS questions are asked at the person level. In addition, the CPS questions and answer categories have changed multiple times over the years. Therefore, comparable data may not be available for certain questions during some years. In addition, some questions may appear to have similar wording as the ACS questions but may not have been asked of the same type of people. Finally, weighting procedures differ between the two surveys. Condominium Status and Fee The data on condominium housing units were obtained from Housing Question 16 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at occupied housing units. Condominium Status – Condominium is a type of ownership that enables a person to own an apartment or house in a development of similarly owned units and to hold a common or joint ownership in some or all of the common areas and facilities such as land, roof, hallways, entrances, elevators, swimming pool, etc. Condominiums may be single-family houses as well as units in apartment buildings. Renters don’t always report condo fees, as they may be collected as part of the rent. Therefore, ACS data are only shown for owner- occupied condominiums. Condominium Fee – A condominium fee normally is charged monthly to the owners of the individual condominium units by the condominium owners’ association to cover operating, maintenance, administrative, and improvement costs of the common property (grounds, halls, lobby, parking areas, laundry rooms, swimming pool, etc.). The costs for utilities and/or fuels may be included in the condominium fee if the units do not have separate meters. Data on condominium fees may include real estate taxes and/or insurance payments for the common property, but do not include real estate taxes or fire, hazard, and flood insurance reported in Housing Questions 20 and 21 (in the 2023 ACS) for the individual unit. Amounts reported were the regular monthly payment, even if paid by someone outside the household or remain unpaid. Costs were estimated as closely as possible when exact costs were not known. The data from this question were added to payments for mortgages (both first, second, home equity loans, and other junior mortgages); real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood insurance payments; and utilities and fuels to derive “Selected Monthly Owner Costs” and “Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income” for condominium owners. These data provide information on the cost of home ownership and offer an excellent measure of housing affordability and excessive shelter costs. By listing the condominium status and fee separately on the questionnaire, the data also serve to improving the accuracy of estimating monthly housing costs for mortgaged owners. Question/Concept History – Since 1996, the ACS included the question on condominium status with one that asked for condominium fees. The words “or mobile home,” and an instruction for renters to enter the amount of the condominium fee only if the fee was in addition to rent, were added starting in 1999. Comparability – Data on condominium status and fee in the 2023 ACS can be compared to previous ACS and Census 2000 condominium status and fee data. However, some caution should be used when using estimates that include condominium fee data (e.g. Selected Monthly Owner Costs, ACS PUMS data, etc.), particularly higher categories and upper quartiles, to those in previous years as there was a change in 2020 to the maximum allowed condominium fee. Contract Rent The data on contract rent (also referred to as “rent asked” for vacant units) were obtained from Housing Question 18a in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at renter-occupied housing units, and vacant housing units that were for rent, and vacant units rented but not occupied at the time of interview. Housing units that are renter occupied without payment of rent are shown separately as “No rent paid.” The unit may be owned by friends or relatives who live elsewhere and who allow occupancy without charge. Rent-free houses or apartments may be provided to compensate caretakers, ministers, tenant farmers, sharecroppers, or others.",

Housing units that are renter occupied without payment of rent are shown separately as “No rent paid.” The unit may be owned by friends or relatives who live elsewhere and who allow occupancy without charge. Rent-free houses or apartments may be provided to compensate caretakers, ministers, tenant farmers, sharecroppers, or others. Contract rent is the monthly rent agreed to or contracted for, regardless of any furnishings, utilities, fees, meals, or services that may be included. For vacant units, it is the monthly rent asked for the rental unit at the time of interview. If the contract rent includes rent for a business unit or for living quarters occupied by another household, only that part of the rent estimated to be for the respondent's unit was included. Excluded was any rent paid for additional units or for business premises. If a renter receives payments from lodgers or roomers who are listed as members of the household, the rent without deduction for any payments received from the lodgers or roomers was to be reported. The respondent was to report the rent agreed to or contracted for even if paid by someone else such as friends or relatives living elsewhere, a church or welfare agency.The respondent was to exclude subsidies paid by a local housing authority or other agency. Contract rent provides information on the monthly housing cost expenses for renters. When the data is used in conjunction with utility costs and income data, the information offers an excellent measure of housing affordability and excessive shelter costs. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of people at different economic levels and to provide assistance to agencies in determining policies on fair rent. Adjusting Contract Rent for Inflation – To inflate contract rent amounts from previous years, the dollar values are inflated to the latest year’s dollar values by multiplying by a factor equal to the average annual Consumer Price Index (CPI-U-RS-All items) factor for the current year, divided by the average annual CPI-U-RS-All items factor for the earlier/earliest year. Median and Quartile Contract Rent – The median divides the rent distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median contract rent and one-half above the median. Quartiles divide the rent distribution into four equal parts. Median and quartile contract rent are computed on the basis of a standard distribution. (See the “Median Standard Distributions” section in Appendix A.) In computing median and quartile contract rent, units reported as “No rent paid” are excluded. Median and quartile rent calculations are rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Upper and lower quartiles can be used to note large rent differences among various geographic areas. The median contract rent explanation is comparable to the description used for Median Gross Rent. (For more information, see “Median” and “Quartile” under “Derived Measures.”) Aggregate Contract Rent – Aggregate contract rent is calculated by adding the contract rents for all renter-occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate contract rent is rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. This explanation is comparable to the description used for Aggregate Gross Rent.

(For more information, see “Aggregate” under “Derived Measures.”) Aggregate Rent Asked – Aggregate rent asked is calculated by adding the asking rents for all vacant-for-rent and rented, not occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate rent asked is rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. (For more information, see “Aggregate” under “Derived Measures.”) Question/Concept History – Since 1996, the ACS questionnaires provided a space for the respondent to enter a dollar amount. The words “or mobile home” were added to the was shown for all renter-occupied housing units and rent asked was shown for all vacant-for- rent housing units in an area. In previous years (1996-2003), it was shown only for specified renter occupied and specified vacant-for-rent housing units. (For more information, see “Specified Owner-Occupied and Vacant-For-Sale Units” and “Specified Renter-Occupied and Vacant-For-Rent Units.”) In 2005, the combined vacancy status category of “rented or sold, not occupied” was split into two categories: “rented, not occupied” and “sold, not occupied.” Beginning in 2005, then, the rented, not occupied housing units were combined with vacant-for-rent units to form the universe of vacant rental units used in publication tables. not released for total renter-occupied units or total vacant-for-rent housing units. The universes in Census 2000 were “specified renter-occupied housing units” and “specified vacant-for-rent housing units” whereas the universes in the 2023 ACS were “renter- occupied housing units” and “vacant-for-rent and rented, not occupied housing units”. Thus medians and quartiles, in the 2023 ACS can be compared to previous ACS data on contract rent. Some caution, however, should be exercised in comparing the share of each by categories, particularly higher categories and upper quartiles, to those in previous years as Food Stamp/Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Benefits (SNAP) The data on SNAP benefits were obtained from Housing Question 15 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The Food Stamp Act of 1977 defines this federally-funded program as one intended to “permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet” (from Title XIII of Public Law 95-113, The Food Stamp Act of 1977, declaration of policy). Food purchasing power is increased by providing eligible households with cards that can be used to purchase food. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers SNAP through state and local welfare offices. SNAP is the major national income support program to which all low-income and low-resource households, regardless of household characteristics, are eligible. In Puerto Rico, the program is named the Nutrition Assistance Program (NAP). On October 1, 2008, the Federal Food Stamp program was renamed SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). Respondents were asked if one or more of the current members received benefits from the food stamp program or SNAP during the past 12 months. Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS asked for a 12-month amount for the value of the food stamps following the Yes response category. For the 1999-2002 ACS, the words “Food Stamps” were capitalized in the question following the Yes response category, and the instruction “Past 12 months’ value – Dollars” was added. Since 2003, the words “received during the past 12 months” were added to the question following the Yes response category. Beginning in 2008, the value of food stamps received was no longer collected; the wording of the question was changed from “At anytime during the past 12 months” to “In the past 12 months.”. Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Many types of GQ populations have SNAP distributions that are very different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the SNAP distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the Food Stamp benefits question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Receipt of Food Stamps” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Receipt of Food Stamps” in the search box. Comparability – The Food Stamp/SNAP question was not asked in Census 2000. Because of the wording change on the 2008 ACS questionnaire, you cannot compare data before 2008 to data after 2008. However, you can compare 2008 data to 2009 and later. Gross Rent The data on gross rent were obtained from answers to Housing Questions 14a-d and 18a in estimated average monthly cost of utilities (electricity, gas, and water and sewer) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.) if these are paid by the renter (or paid for the renter by someone else). Gross rent is intended to eliminate differentials that result from varying practices with respect to the inclusion of utilities and fuels as part of the rental payment. The estimated costs of water and sewer, and fuels are reported on a 12-month basis but are converted to monthly figures for the tabulations. Renter units occupied without payment of rent are shown separately as “No rent paid” in the tabulations.",

Insurance for Fire, Hazard, and Flood The data on fire, hazard, and flood insurance were obtained from Housing Question 21 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked of owner-occupied units. The statistics for this question refer to the annual premium for fire, hazard, and flood insurance on the property (land and buildings), that is, policies that protect the property and its contents against loss due to damage by fire, lightning, winds, hail, flood, explosion, and so on. Liability policies are included only if they are paid with the fire, hazard, and flood insurance premiums and the amounts for fire, hazard, and flood cannot be separated.

The data show the type of fuel used most to heat the house, apartment, or mobile home. used by planners to identify the types of fuel used in certain areas and the consequences this usage may have on the area. The data also serve to aid in forecasting the need for future energy needs and power facilities such as generating plants, long distance pipelines for oil or natural gas, and long distance transmission lines for electricity. Utility Gas – This category includes gas piped through underground pipes from a central system to serve the neighborhood. Bottled, Tank, or LP Gas – This category includes liquid propane gas stored in bottles or tanks that are refilled or exchanged when empty. Electricity – This category includes electricity that is generally supplied by means of above or underground electric power lines. Fuel Oil, Kerosene, etc. – This category includes fuel oil, kerosene, gasoline, alcohol, and other combustible liquids. Coal or Coke – This category includes coal or coke that is usually distributed by truck. Wood – This category includes purchased wood, wood cut by household members on their property or elsewhere, driftwood, sawmill or construction scraps, or the like. Solar Energy – This category includes heat provided by sunlight that is collected, stored, and actively distributed to most of the rooms. Other Fuel – This category includes all other fuels not specified elsewhere. No Fuel Used – This category includes units that do not use any fuel or that do not have heating equipment. Question/Concept History – Since 1996, the ACS questions have remained the same. Household Size This question is based on the count of people in occupied housing units. All people occupying the housing unit are counted, including the householder, occupants related to the householder, and roommates, housemates, and so forth. Average Household Size of Occupied Unit – A measure obtained by dividing the number of people living in occupied housing units by the total number of occupied housing units. This measure is rounded to the nearest hundredth. Average Household Size of Owner-occupied Unit – A measure obtained by dividing the number of people living in owner-occupied housing units by the total number of owner- occupied housing units.

These data provide assistance in determining areas that are eligible for programs and funding, such as Meals on Wheels. The data also serve to aid in the development of policies based on fair market rent and to identify areas in need of rehabilitation loans or grants. Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS questions asked whether the house or apartment had complete kitchen facilities, requiring that the three facilities all be in the same unit. In 1999, “mobile home” was added to the question, along with the capitalization of the word “COMPLETE” for emphasis. Starting in 2008, the structure of the question changed and combined kitchen facilities with plumbing facilities and telephone service availability into one question to ask, “Does this house, apartment, or mobile home have-” and provided the respondent with a “Yes” or “No” checkbox for each component needed for complete facilities. Also in 2008, the component “sink with piped water” was changed to “sink with a faucet.” Comparability – Caution should be used when comparing ACS data on kitchen facilities from the years 2008 and after with both pre-2008 ACS and Census 2000 data. Changes made to the kitchen facilities question between the 2007 and 2008 ACS involving the wording as well as the response option resulted in an inconsistency in the ACS data. This inconsistency in the data was most noticeable as an increase in housing units \"lacking complete kitchen facilities.\" Meals Included in Rent The data on meals included in the rent were obtained from Housing Question 18b in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked of occupied housing units that were rented and vacant housing units that were for rent or rented but not yet occupied at the time of enumeration. These data only include rental units, which meals are included in the rent, or if occupants contract for either their meals or a meal plan in order to live in the unit. Renters in continuing care or life facilities are included in this category if their contracts cover meal services. The meals included in rent allows for a measurement on the amount of congregate housing within the housing inventory.

Mobile Home Costs The data on mobile home costs were obtained from Housing Question 24 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at owner-occupied mobile homes. These data include the total yearly costs for personal property taxes, land or site rent, registration fees, and license fees on all owner-occupied mobile homes. The instructions are to exclude real estate taxes already reported in Question 20. Additionally, the mobile home costs exclude installment loan payments on the purchase of the mobile home, as respondents are instructed to include these payments in Question 22b about the mortgage payment amount. Costs are estimated as closely as possible when exact costs are not known. Amounts are the total for an entire 12-month billing period, even if they are paid by someone outside the household or remain unpaid. The data from this question are added to payments for mortgages; real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood insurance payments; utilities; and fuels to derive “Selected Monthly Owner Costs” and “Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income” for mobile home owners. These data provide information on the cost of home ownership and offer an excellent measure of housing affordability and excessive shelter costs. Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS questions were the same. Between 1999 and 2002, the question had a lead-in question on whether the respondent had an installment loan or a contract on the mobile home. The question then asked for total costs including any installment loan. Beginning in 2003, the lead-in question was removed and the question about mobile home costs was worded in its current form. Comparability – Data on mobile home costs in the 2023 ACS can be compared to previous ACS and Census 2000 mobile home costs data. However, some caution should be used when using estimates that include mobile home costs data (e.g. Selected Monthly Owner Costs, ACS PUMS data, etc.), particularly higher categories and upper quartiles, to those in previous years as there was a change in 2020 to the maximum allowable mobile home costs.",

Comparability – Data on mobile home costs in the 2023 ACS can be compared to previous ACS and Census 2000 mobile home costs data. However, some caution should be used when using estimates that include mobile home costs data (e.g. Selected Monthly Owner Costs, ACS PUMS data, etc.), particularly higher categories and upper quartiles, to those in previous years as there was a change in 2020 to the maximum allowable mobile home costs. Monthly Housing Costs The data for monthly housing costs are developed from a distribution of “Selected Monthly Owner Costs” for owner-occupied units and “Gross Rent” for renter-occupied units. The owner-occupied categories are further separated into those with a mortgage and those without a mortgage. See the sections on “Selected Monthly Owner Costs” and “Gross Rent” for more details on what characteristics are included in each measure and how these data are comparable to previous ACS and Census 2000 data. Monthly housing costs provide information on the cost of monthly housing expenses for owners and renters. When the data is used in conjunction with income data, the information offers an excellent measure of housing affordability and excessive shelter costs. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of people at different economic levels. Median Monthly Housing Costs – This measure divides the monthly housing costs distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median monthly housing costs and one-half above the median. Medians are shown separately for units “with a mortgage” and for units “not mortgaged.” Median monthly housing costs are computed on the basis of a standard distribution. (See the “Median Standard Distributions” section under Appendix A.) Median monthly housing costs are rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Monthly Housing Costs as a Percentage of Household Income The data for monthly housing costs as a percentage of household income are developed from a distribution of “Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income” for owner-occupied and “Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income” for renter-occupied units. The owner-occupied categories are further separated into those with a mortgage and those without a mortgage.

These data include the total yearly costs for personal property taxes, land or site rent, registration fees, and license fees on all owner-occupied mobile homes. The instructions are to exclude real estate taxes already reported in Question 20. Additionally, the mobile home costs exclude installment loan payments on the purchase of the mobile home, as respondents are instructed to include these payments in Question 22b about the mortgage payment amount. Costs are estimated as closely as possible when exact costs are not known. Amounts are the total for an entire 12-month billing period, even if they are paid by someone outside the household or remain unpaid. The data from this question are added to payments for mortgages; real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood insurance payments; utilities; and fuels to derive “Selected Monthly Owner Costs” and “Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income” for mobile home owners.

Mortgage Payment The data on mortgage payment were obtained from Housing Question 22b in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at owner-occupied units that have a mortgage, deed of trust, or similar debt; or contract to purchase. The question provides the regular monthly amount required to be paid to the lender for the first mortgage (deed of trust, contract to purchase, or similar debt) on the property. Amounts are included even if the payments are delinquent or paid by someone else. The amounts reported are included in the computation of “Selected Monthly Owner Costs” and “Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income” for units with a mortgage. The amounts reported include everything paid to the lender including principal and interest payments; real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood insurance payments; and mortgage insurance premiums. Separate questions determine whether real estate taxes and fire, hazard, and flood insurance payments are included in the mortgage payment to the lender.

For Census 2000, tables for both total owner-occupied housing units and specified owner-occupied housing units were released, thus comparisons can be made only when comparing the same universes between the two data sets. Mortgage Status The data on mortgage status were obtained from Housing Questions 22a and 23a in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The questions were asked at owner-occupied units. “Mortgage” refers to all forms of debt where the property is pledged as security for repayment of the debt, including deeds of trust; trust deeds; contracts to purchase; land contracts; junior mortgages; and home equity loans. A mortgage is considered a first mortgage if it has prior claim over any other mortgage or if it is the only mortgage on the property. All other mortgages (second, third, etc.) are considered junior mortgages. If no first mortgage is reported, but a junior mortgage is reported, then the loan is considered a first mortgage. However, starting with the 2020 ACS release, even though a home equity loan is considered a junior mortgage, if a respondent reports only a home equity loan and no other loan, these home equity loans will not be considered a first mortgage.

Other Vacancy Status During the collection of vacancy status for housing units that are vacant (see the section on Vacancy Status), the data on other vacancy status were obtained only for those vacant units that are classified in the “Other vacant” category. These data help provide additional information about vacant housing beyond the six primary vacancy status classifications. Both public and private organizations use these data to better assess housing markets and the supply and demand for housing. Other vacant units are subdivided and classified as follows: Foreclosure – These are vacant units because the owner's payments (mortgage, taxes, or loans) to their lending institution, city, or state, were no longer being made. This includes units that are under foreclosure, bank owned, bankrupt, up for auction, sheriff's sale, repossessed, have a lien, or taken for taxes. Personal/Family reasons – These are vacant units due to the owner's preferences and/or personal situation. This includes units where the owner does not want to rent or sell, the owner is deciding what to do, the owner is keeping for family use, the owner is staying with family, or the owner is in assisted living or another type of care situation. Legal proceedings – These are vacant due to legal issues or disputes with the unit. This includes units held for the settlement of an estate, in probate, involved in divorce or eviction proceedings, or where the owner is deceased. This also includes units with code violations. Preparing to rent/sell – These are vacant because the owner is currently preparing to rent or sell the unit. This includes units that will be placed for rent or for sale this month. Held for storage of household furniture – These are vacant because the unit is used to store excess household furniture or other household items. Needs repairs – These are vacant because the unit is in need of repairs. This includes units that are in need of repair, renovations, or cleaning, but are not currently being repaired, renovated, or cleaned. Currently being repaired/renovated – These are vacant because the unit is currently undergoing repairs. This includes units that are being repaired, renovated, refurbished, or cleaned. Specific use housing – These are vacant because the unit is only used by a specific group of people at one or various times throughout the year. This includes military housing, employee/corporate housing, transient quarters, units held by a church, model home/apartment, or guest house. Extended absence – These are vacant because the unit is intended for year-round occupancy but is vacant for 6 months or more. This includes units where the owner is on extended work or military assignment, temporarily out of the country, or in jail or another type of detention situation. Abandoned/Possibly condemned – These are vacant because the unit is abandoned. This also includes units that are said to be demolished or condemned, but where there is no positive evidence such as a sign, notice, or mark on the house or in the block to indicate the unit is to be demolished or condemned. Other – If the other vacant unit does not fall into any of the categories specified above, it is classified as “Other.” This also includes units where the knowledgeable respondent and/or Census Bureau representative does not know why the unit is vacant. Question/Concept History – The ACS began publishing 1-year estimates for other vacancy status in 2021. Comparability – Data on other vacancy status in the 2023 ACS can be compared to previous ACS data. Do not compare vacancy estimates between the ACS and decennial census because differences in the design, data collection methods and residency rules between the ACS and the decennial census may materially affect estimates of vacancy rates.

Owner-Occupied Units See Tenure. Plumbing Facilities The data on plumbing facilities were obtained from Housing Question 7a and b in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. Complete plumbing facilities include: (a) hot and cold running water and (b) a bathtub or shower. Both facilities must be located inside the house, apartment, or mobile home, but not necessarily in the same room. Housing units are classified as lacking complete plumbing facilities when either of the two facilities is not present. Plumbing facilities provide an indication of living standards and assess the quality of household facilities within the housing inventory. These data provide assistance in the assessment of water resources and to serve as an aid to identify possible areas of ground water contamination. The data also are used to forecast the need for additional water and sewage facilities, aid in the development of policies based on fair market rent, and to identify areas in need of rehabilitation loans or grants. Question/Concept History – The 1996-2007 ACS questions were stand-alone questions that asked the respondent to answer either “Yes, has all three facilities” (before 2016, a housing unit with complete plumbing had to have hot and cold piped (later changed to running) water, a flush toilet, and a bathtub or shower) or “No” to the question of whether the housing unit had complete plumbing facilities, requiring that the facilities all be in the same unit. Starting in 2008, the structure of the question changed and combined plumbing facilities with kitchen facilities and telephone service availability into one question. The one question had multiple components including the three plumbing facilities. It asked individually for each plumbing facility, “Does this house, apartment, or mobile home have -” and provided the respondent with a “Yes” or “No” checkbox for each component needed for complete plumbing facilities (and also for the components of complete kitchen and telephone service; in 2019, telephone service was broken out into a separate question). An additional change introduced in 2008 included changing the description of the component “hot and cold piped water” to “hot and cold running water.” In 2013, the question changed for Puerto Rico as follows: “hot and cold running water” was changed to “running water” and “water heater” yes-no checkbox was added to the plumbing facilities, although the presence of a water heater in a home in Puerto Rico was not necessary for the home to be considered to have complete plumbing. So Puerto Rico, like the US, only had the three requirements for complete plumbing. In 2016, ACS no longer asked if the housing unit had a flush toilet. So by 2016, there were only two plumbing facilities – hot and cold running water (running water for Puerto Rico) and a bathtub or shower required for complete plumbing. Comparability – Caution should be used when comparing ACS data on plumbing facilities from the years 2008 and after with both pre-2008 ACS and Census 2000 data. Changes made to the plumbing facilities question between 2007 and 2008 ACS involving the wording as well as the response option resulted in an inconsistency in the ACS data. This inconsistency in the data was most noticeable as an increase in housing units \"lacking complete plumbing facilities.\" This increase in housing units “lacking complete plumbing” was most noticeable in Puerto Rico, when a component of complete plumbing was hot and cold running water. Due to the temperate climate there, hot water was not common there; thus many housing units that would have had complete plumbing under “Yes, has all three facilities” did not",

Population in Occupied Housing Units The data shown for population in occupied units is the total population minus any people living in group quarters. All people occupying the housing unit are counted, including the householder, occupants related to the householder, and roommates, housemates, and so forth. Population in occupied housing units provides information on the population within the housing inventory. The data allow the identification of population patterns within areas to assist in developing housing programs. These data also serve to aid officials in tracking the changing population characteristics of the housing inventory over time. Comparability – Data on the population in occupied housing units in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS) can be compared to previous ACS data. The ACS estimates of occupied housing units differ from those obtained from the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census. For more information on why estimates for this topic may differ between the ACS and decennial census, see “Comparing 2010 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates of Occupancy Status, Vacancy Status, and Household Size with the 2010 Census – Preliminary Results” on the Census website. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter the paper title in the search box. Poverty Status of Households The data on poverty status of households were derived from answers to the income questions. Since poverty is defined at the family level and not the household level, the poverty status of the household is determined by the poverty status of the householder. Households are classified as poor when the total income of the householder’s family is below the appropriate poverty threshold (For nonfamily householders, their own income is compared with the appropriate threshold.). The income of people living in the household who are unrelated to the householder is not considered when determining the poverty status of a household, nor does their presence affect the family size in determining the appropriate threshold. The poverty thresholds vary depending on three criteria: size of family, number of related children, and, for 1-and 2-person families, age of householder. See the table “The 2022 Poverty Factors” in Appendix A. (For more information, see “Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months” and “Income in the Past 12 Months” under “Population Variables.”) Real Estate Taxes The data on real estate taxes were obtained from Housing Question 20 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at owner-occupied units. The statistics from this question refer to the total amount of all real estate taxes on the entire property (land and buildings) payable to all taxing jurisdictions, including special assessments, school taxes, county taxes, and so forth. Real estate taxes include state, local, and all other real estate taxes even if delinquent, unpaid, or paid by someone who is not a member of the household. However, taxes due from prior years are not included. If taxes are paid on other than a yearly basis, the payments are converted to a yearly basis. The payment for real estate taxes is added to payments for fire, hazard, and flood insurance; utilities and fuels; and mortgages (both first and second mortgages, home equity loans, and other junior mortgages) to derive “Selected Monthly Owner Costs” and “Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income.” These data provide information on the cost of home ownership and offer an excellent measure of housing affordability and excessive shelter costs. A separate question (Question 22c in the 2023 ACS) determines whether real estate taxes are included in the mortgage payment to the lender(s). This makes it possible to avoid counting taxes twice in the computations. Question/Concept History – Since 1996, the ACS questions have been the same. Comparability – Data on real estate taxes in the 2023 ACS should not be compared to Census 2000 real estate taxes data. The universe in Census 2000 was “specified owner-occupied housing units” whereas the universe in the ACS is “owner occupied housing units,” thus comparisons cannot be made between these two data sets. When comparing to ACS data from previous years, some caution should be used when using estimates that include real estate tax data (e.g. Selected Monthly Owner Costs, ACS PUMS data, etc.), particularly higher categories and upper quartiles, as there was a change in 2020 to the maximum allowable real estate taxes.

Rooms The data on rooms were obtained from Housing Question 6a in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. The statistics on rooms are in terms of the number of housing units with a specified number of rooms. The intent of this question is to count the number of whole rooms used for living purposes. For each unit, rooms include living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, bedrooms, finished recreation rooms, enclosed porches suitable for year-round use, and lodger's rooms. Excluded are strip or pullman kitchens, bathrooms, open porches, balconies, halls or foyers, half-rooms, utility rooms, unfinished attics or basements, or other unfinished space used for storage. A partially divided room is a separate room only if there is a partition from floor to ceiling, but not if the partition consists solely of shelves or cabinets. Rooms provide the basis for estimating the amount of living and sleeping spaces within a housing unit. These data allow officials to plan and allocate funding for additional housing to relieve crowded housing conditions. The data also serve to aid in planning for future services and infrastructure, such as home energy assistance programs and the development of waste treatment facilities. Median Rooms – This measure divides the room distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median number of rooms and one-half above the median. In computing median rooms, the whole number is used as the midpoint of the interval; thus, the category “3 rooms” is treated as an interval ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 rooms. Median rooms is rounded to the nearest tenth. (For more information on medians, see the discussion under “Derived Measures.”) Aggregate Rooms – Aggregate rooms is calculated by adding all of the rooms for housing units in an area. (For more information on aggregates, see “Derived Measures.”) Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided a space for a write-in entry on the number of rooms. From 1999-2007, the question provided response categories from “1 room” to “9 or more rooms.” Starting in 2008, the response categories were removed and a write-in box was added for the respondent to enter the number of rooms. Additional changes introduced in 2008 included adding the word “separate” to the question stem, adding an instruction that defines a “room,” adding an inclusion instruction to include bedrooms and kitchens in the count of rooms, and changing the current exclusion instruction by removing the word “half-room” and adding the phrase “unfinished basements.”",

These data allow officials to plan and allocate funding for additional housing to relieve crowded housing conditions. The data also serve to aid in planning for future services and infrastructure, such as home energy assistance programs and the development of waste treatment facilities. Median Rooms – This measure divides the room distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median number of rooms and one-half above the median. In computing median rooms, the whole number is used as the midpoint of the interval; thus, the category “3 rooms” is treated as an interval ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 rooms. Median rooms is rounded to the nearest tenth. (For more information on medians, see the discussion under “Derived Measures.”) Aggregate Rooms – Aggregate rooms is calculated by adding all of the rooms for housing units in an area. (For more information on aggregates, see “Derived Measures.”) Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided a space for a write-in entry on the number of rooms. From 1999-2007, the question provided response categories from “1 room” to “9 or more rooms.” Starting in 2008, the response categories were removed and a write-in box was added for the respondent to enter the number of rooms. Additional changes introduced in 2008 included adding the word “separate” to the question stem, adding an instruction that defines a “room,” adding an inclusion instruction to include bedrooms and kitchens in the count of rooms, and changing the current exclusion instruction by removing the word “half-room” and adding the phrase “unfinished basements.”",

Second or Junior Mortgage Payments or Home Equity Loan The data on second mortgages or home equity loan payments were obtained from Housing Questions 23a and 23b in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The questions were asked at owner-occupied units. Question 23a asks whether a second mortgage or a home equity loan exists on the property. Question 23b provides the regular monthly amount required to be paid to the lender on all second and junior mortgages and home equity loans. Amounts are included even if the payments are delinquent or paid by someone else. The amounts reported are included in the computation of “Selected Monthly Owner Costs” and “Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income” for units with a mortgage. All mortgages other than first mortgages (for example, second, third, etc.) are classified as “junior” mortgages. A second mortgage is a junior mortgage that gives the lender a claim against the property that is second to the claim of the holder of the first mortgage. Any other junior mortgage(s) would be subordinate to the second mortgage. A home equity loan is a line of credit available to the borrower that is secured by real estate. It may be placed on a property that already has a first or second mortgage, or it may be placed on a property that is owned free and clear. If the respondents answered that no first mortgage existed, but a second mortgage did, a computer edit assigned the unit a first mortgage and made the first mortgage monthly payment the amount reported in the second mortgage. The second mortgage loan data was then made “No” in Question 23a and blank in Question 23b. This is not the case for a respondent that answered that no first mortgage existed, but a home equity loan for the unit did. Starting with the 2020 ACS, the categorization of no first mortgage currently existing while having a home equity loan is a permissible response. In these instances, the monthly payment amount reported for the home equity loan is not converted to a first mortgage monthly payment.",

Second mortgage or home equity loan data provide information on the monthly housing cost expenses for owners. When the data is used in conjunction with income data, the information offers an excellent measure of housing affordability and excessive shelter costs. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs aimed to meet the needs of people at different economic levels. By listing the second mortgage or home equity loan question separately on the questionnaire from other housing cost questions, the data also serve to improve the accuracy of estimating monthly housing costs for mortgaged owners. Question/Concept History – Since 1996, the ACS questions remained the same. Comparability – Data on second mortgages in the 2023 ACS should not be compared to Census 2000 second mortgage data. For Census 2000, while some tables were released for total owner-occupied units, second mortgage was not. The universe in Census 2000 was “specified owner-occupied housing units” whereas the universe in the ACS is “owner- occupied housing units,” thus comparisons cannot be made between these two data sets. Selected Conditions The variable “Selected Conditions” is defined for owner- and renter-occupied housing units as having at least one of the following conditions: 1) lacking complete plumbing facilities, 2) lacking complete kitchen facilities, 3) with 1.01 or more occupants per room, 4) selected monthly owner costs as a percentage of household income greater than 30 percent, and 5) gross rent as a percentage of household income greater than 30 percent.

Question/Concept History – Since 1996, the ACS questions have been the same. The ACS collected the monthly cost of electricity and gas, and the 12-month cost of water and sewer shown for all owner-occupied housing units. In previous years (1996-2003), the question was shown only for specified owner-occupied housing units. between the ACS and Census 2000. For Census 2000, tables for both total owner-occupied housing units and specified owner-occupied housing units were released, thus comparisons can be made only when comparing the same universes between the two data sets. Additionally, for Census 2000, tables with full distributions were released for total owner- occupied housing units, but medians were not shown. Caution should also be used when PUMS data, etc.), particularly higher categories and upper quartiles, to those in previous years as there was a change in 2020 to maximum allowable amounts for several variables that computed separately for each unit and rounded to the nearest whole percentage. The data are tabulated only for owner-occupied units. Separate distributions are often shown for units “with a mortgage” and for units “not mortgaged.” Units occupied by households reporting no income or a net loss are included in the “not computed” category.

(See the “Median Standard Distributions” section under rounded to the nearest tenth. (For more information on medians, see “Derived Measures.”) Comparability –For Census 2000, tables were not released for total owner-occupied units. The universe in the ACS is \"owner-occupied\" whereas in Census 2000, the universe was \"specified owner-occupied housing units,\" thus comparisons cannot be made. Caution should be used when using estimates that include real estate tax data (e.g. Selected Monthly Owner Costs as a Percentage of Household Income, ACS PUMS data, etc.), particularly higher categories and upper quartiles, to those in previous years as there was a change in 2020 to maximum allowable amounts for several variables that comprise Selected Monthly Owner Costs . Specified Owner-Occupied and Vacant-for-Sale Units Specified owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale units include only 1-family houses on less than 10 acres (cuerdas). The data for “specified units” exclude mobile homes, houses on 10 or more acres (cuerdas), and housing units in multiunit buildings. (Specified is rarely used any longer, although specified units can be determined using pre-2016 ACS data for cautious comparisons to Census 2000 and earlier decennial data.) Before 2004, specified owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale housing unit information was used to maintain a comparable universe between the American Community Survey (ACS) and earlier decennial census data. Owner costs, owner costs as a percentage of income, and value for owner-occupied and asking price for vacant-for-sale housing units in earlier census data (1990 and prior; in 2000, Census published both) were based on specified owner- occupied and vacant-for-sale housing units; however, beginning in 2004 the ACS no longer published information solely for this universe. Rather, the ACS began publishing information for all owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale and sold, not occupied housing units. The characteristics for a specified owner housing unit (acreage, building type, and before 2016, whether or not there was a business on the property) as well as a single variable SVAL that combines all the characteristics necessary to be a specified unit into one variable are maintained within the ACS Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) file ensuring that comparisons between the two data sets can be made. Through 2015 then, comparisons between the ACS and earlier decennial census data sets can be made by using the PUMS to extract specified units to which to compare to 1990 and prior decennial census data. In 2016, ACS stopped asking whether there was a business or medical office on property, the lack of which was formerly a characteristic required to be considered specified in both ACS and decennial census data. So, although there is still the single variable that combines all the characteristics for specified owner housing in 2016 and later ACS PUMS, it is not directly comparable to preceding years which had the requirement of no business or medical office on property. Question/Concept History – Prior to 1990, much of the owner-occupied housing inventory was comprised of single-family homes, either detached or attached. Therefore, earlier census data provided financial housing characteristics for the specified owner-occupied unit universe. However, the housing market began to change during the 1990’s as an increasing number of units in multiunit structures were constructed and sold as condominiums, as well as the increase of mobile homes as an option for lower-income owners to purchase a home. As a result of these changes, the ACS abandoned the concept of the specified owner- occupied universe to ensure housing data was provided for all owner-occupied units. Comparability – Since 2004, the ACS only publishes financial housing characteristics for all owner-occupied units. (ACS no longer publishes tables of the characteristics of vacant units other than the vacancy status and whether the units are temporarily occupied or not.) The ACS PUMS files will still provide the individual characteristics of a specified owner housing unit (acreage and building type) needed to construct specified. The ACS PUMS will also provide a single variable (SVAL) that combines the characteristics necessary for specified owner housing. However, in 2016, the question about the presence of a business or medical office on the property, which was formerly required for an owner unit to be specified, was dropped. The ACS PUMS still provide the acreage and building type characteristics to construct specified and there is still the variable SVAL, which is now composed to just two of the three characteristics of specified.

For Census 2000, tables were released for both all owner-occupied and all vacant-for-sale units and the more restricted universe of specified owner-occupied and specified vacant-for- sale units. So caution must be exercised to choose the universe for all owner-occupied units if published data tables from ACS files prior to 2016 are to be compared directly to Census 2000 data. Comparisons for specified owner-occupied units between these two data sets can only be made if the characteristics of a specified owner-occupied or vacant-for sale unit (acreage and building type) or the single variable SVAL from the ACS PUMS (prior to 2016) are used to construct the same specified owner universe as Census 2000. Beginning in 2016, the ACS cannot be compared to either Census 2000 or to ACS in previous years due to the elimination of the business or medical office on property question.

(Specified is rarely used any longer, although specified units can be determined for cautious comparisons to earlier decennial census data.)

Telephone Service Available The data on telephone service availability were obtained from Housing Question 8 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at occupied housing units. The question asked whether any member of the household could both make and receive phone calls while at the house, apartment, or mobile home. Respondents are instructed to mark “Yes” if any household member has a working cell phone, smartphone, or any other type of phone device, or if the housing unit has a land line telephone in working order. Households whose service has been discontinued for nonpayment or other reasons are not counted as having telephone service available. The availability of telephone service provides information on the isolation of households. These data help assess the level of communication access amongst elderly and low-income households. The data also serve to aid in the development of emergency telephone, medical, or crime prevention services. Question/Concept History – For the 1996-1998 ACS, the question asked whether there was a telephone in the house or apartment. A telephone must be inside the house or apartment for the unit to be classified as having a telephone. Units where the respondent used a telephone located inside the building, but not in the respondent's living quarters, were classified as having no telephone. In 1999, the words “or mobile home” were added question to be more inclusive of the structure type. In 2004, instructions that accompanied the ACS mail questionnaire advised respondents that if the household members used cell phones to answer, that the house, apartment, or mobile home had telephone service. Starting in 2008, the structure of the question changed and combined telephone service availability with plumbing facilities and kitchen facilities into one question to ask, “Does this house, apartment, or mobile home have -” and provided the respondent with a “Yes” or “No” checkbox for each component needed for complete facilities. In 2008, the instruction “Include cell phones” was added. Beginning in 2019, the question was removed from the plumbing and kitchen battery of questions/responses and made into a stand alone question.

Limitation of the Data – The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the current version of the telephone service available question in the 2016 ACS Content Test, where this version was then implemented into data collection in 2019. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data between pre-2019 and 2019 and on data estimates. For more information, see “2016 American Community Survey Content Test Evaluation Report: Telephone Service,” found at https://www.census.gov/programs- surveys/acs/methodology/content-test.2017.html. Comparability – Caution should be used when comparing ACS data on telephone service availability from the year 2023 with both pre-2019 ACS and Census 2000 data. In general, changes made to the telephone service availability question beginning in 2019 led to an increase of telephone service availability estimates across most geographies when compared to pre-2019 estimates. Tenure The data for tenure were obtained from Housing Question 17 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at occupied housing units. Occupied housing units are classified as either owner-occupied or renter-occupied. Tenure provides a measurement of home ownership, which has served as an indicator of the nation’s economy for decades. These data are used to aid in the distribution of funds for programs such as those involving mortgage insurance, rental housing, and national defense housing. Data on tenure allows planners to evaluate the overall viability of housing markets and to assess the stability of neighborhoods. The data also serve in understanding the characteristics of owner-occupied and renter-occupied units to aid builders, mortgage lenders, planning officials, government agencies, etc., in the planning of housing programs and services. Owner-Occupied – A housing unit is owner-occupied if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit, even if it is mortgaged or not fully paid for. The owner or co-owner must live in the unit and usually is Person 1 on the questionnaire. The unit is “Owned by you or someone in this household with a mortgage or loan” if it is being purchased with a mortgage or some other debt arrangement such as a deed of trust, trust deed, contract to purchase, land contract, or purchase agreement. The housing unit is also considered owned with a mortgage if there is a home equity line of credit on it. The unit also is considered owned with a mortgage if it is built on leased land and there is a mortgage on the unit. Mobile homes occupied by owners with installment loan balances also are included in this category. A housing unit is “Owned by you or someone in this household free and clear (without a mortgage or loan)” if there is no mortgage or other similar debt on the house, apartment, or",

The unit is “Owned by you or someone in this household with a mortgage or loan” if it is being purchased with a mortgage or some other debt arrangement such as a deed of trust, trust deed, contract to purchase, land contract, or purchase agreement. The housing unit is also considered owned with a mortgage if there is a home equity line of credit on it. The unit also is considered owned with a mortgage if it is built on leased land and there is a mortgage on the unit. Mobile homes occupied by owners with installment loan balances also are included in this category. A housing unit is “Owned by you or someone in this household free and clear (without a mortgage or loan)” if there is no mortgage or other similar debt on the house, apartment, or mobile home, including units built on leased land if the unit is owned outright without a mortgage. Renter-Occupied – All occupied housing units which are not owner-occupied, whether they are rented or occupied without payment of rent, are classified as renter-occupied. “No rent paid” units are separately identified in the rent tabulations. Such units are generally provided free by friends or relatives or in exchange for services such as resident manager, caretaker, minister, or tenant farmer. Housing units on military bases also are classified in the “No rent paid” category. “Rented” includes units in continuing care, sometimes called life care arrangements. These arrangements usually involve a contract between one or more individuals and a health services provider guaranteeing the individual shelter, usually a house or apartment, and services, such as meals or transportation to shopping or recreation. (For more information, see “Meals Included in Rent.”) Question/Concept History – From 1996-2007 the ACS questions were the same. Starting in 2008, the instruction “Mark (X) ONE box.” was added following the question, and the instruction “Include home equity loans.” was added following the response category “Owned by you or someone in this household with a mortgage or loan?” Additional changes introduced in 2008 included revising the wording of two of the response categories from “Rented for cash rent?” to “Rented?” and “Occupied without payment of cash rent?” to “Occupied without payment of rent?” Comparability – Data on tenure in the 2023 ACS can be compared to previous ACS, Census 2020, Census 2010, and Census 2000 tenure data, but compare with caution as ACS estimates can differ from those from the decennial census. Units in Structure The data on units in structure (also referred to as “type of structure”) were obtained from Housing Question 1 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at occupied and vacant housing units. A structure is a separate building that either has open spaces on all sides or is separated from other structures by dividing walls that extend from ground to roof. In determining the number of units in a structure, all housing units, both occupied and vacant, are counted. Stores and office space are excluded. The data are presented for the number of housing units in structures of specified type and size, not for the number of residential buildings. The units in structure provides information on the housing inventory by subdividing the inventory into one-family homes, apartments, and mobile homes. When the data is used in conjunction with tenure, year structure built, and income, units in structure serves as the basic identifier of housing used in many federal programs. The data also serve to aid in the planning of roads, hospitals, utility lines, schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, emergency preparedness plans, and energy consumption and supplies.",

Occupied housing units are classified as either owner-occupied or renter-occupied. nation’s economy for decades. These data are used to aid in the distribution of funds for programs such as those involving mortgage insurance, rental housing, and national defense and to assess the stability of neighborhoods. The data also serve in understanding the characteristics of owner-occupied and renter-occupied units to aid builders, mortgage lenders, planning officials, government agencies, etc., in the planning of housing programs and services.

Mobile Home – Both occupied and vacant mobile homes to which no permanent rooms have been added are counted in this category. Towable recreational vehicles, such as travel trailers or fifth-wheel trailers, are considered mobile homes. Mobile homes used only for business purposes or for extra sleeping space and mobile homes for sale on a dealer's lot, at the factory, or in storage are not counted in the housing inventory. 1-Unit, Detached – This is a 1-unit structure detached from any other house, that is, with open space on all four sides. Such structures are considered detached even if they have an adjoining shed or garage. A one-family house that contains a business is considered detached as long as the building has open space on all four sides. Mobile homes to which one or more permanent rooms have been added or built also are included. 1-Unit, Attached – This is a 1-unit structure that has one or more walls extending from ground to roof separating it from adjoining structures. In row houses (sometimes called townhouses), double houses, or houses attached to nonresidential structures, each house is a separate, attached structure if the dividing or common wall goes from ground to roof. 2 or More Apartments – These are units in structures containing 2 or more housing units, further categorized as units in structures with “2 apartments,” “3 or 4 apartments,” “5 to 9 apartments,” “10 to 19 apartments,” “20 to 49 apartments,” and “50 or more apartments.” Boat, RV, Van, Etc. – This category is for any living quarters occupied as a housing unit that does not fit the previous categories. Examples that fit this category are houseboats, self- propelled recreational vehicles, motor homes, railroad cars, campers, and vans. Recreational vehicles, boats, vans, tents, railroad cars, and the like are included only if they are occupied as someone's current place of residence. Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided the response category, “a mobile home or trailer.” Starting in 1999, the ACS response category dropped “or trailer” to read as “a mobile home.” Comparability – Data on units in structure in the 2023 ACS can be compared to previous ACS and Census 2000 units in structure data. Utility Costs The data on utility costs were obtained from Housing Questions 14a through 14d in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The questions were asked of occupied housing units. The questions about electricity and gas asked for the monthly costs, and the questions about water/sewer and other fuels (oil, coal, wood, kerosene, etc.) asked for the yearly costs. Costs are recorded if paid by or billed to occupants, a welfare agency, relatives, or friends. Costs that are paid by landlords, included in the rent payment, or included in the condominium fee are excluded.",

For Sale Only – These are vacant units being offered “for sale only,” including units in cooperatives and condominium projects if the individual units are offered “for sale only.” If units are offered either “for rent” or “for sale,” they are included in the “for rent” classification. Sold, Not Occupied – These are vacant units sold but not yet occupied, including units that have been sold recently, but the new owner has not yet moved in. For Seasonal, Recreational, or Occasional Use – These are vacant units used or intended for use only in certain seasons or for weekends or other occasional use throughout the year. Seasonal units include those used for summer or winter sports or recreation, such as beach cottages and hunting cabins. Seasonal units also may include quarters for such workers as herders and loggers. Interval ownership units, sometimes called shared-ownership or time- sharing condominiums, also are included here. For Migrant Workers – These are vacant units used or intended for occupancy by migrant workers employed in farm work during the crop season. (Work in a cannery, a freezer plant, or a food-processing plant is not farm work.) Other Vacant – If a vacant unit does not fall into any of the categories specified above, it is classified as “Other vacant.” See the section Other Vacancy Status for more details on the vacant units that are classified as “Other vacant.” Homeowner Vacancy Rate – The homeowner vacancy rate is the proportion of the homeowner inventory that is vacant “for sale.” It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units “for sale only” by the sum of the owner-occupied units, vacant units that are “for sale only,” and vacant units that have been “sold but not yet occupied”, and then multiplying by 100.

Do not compare vacancy estimates between the ACS and decennial census because differences in the design, data collection methods and residency rules between the ACS and the decennial census may materially affect estimates of vacancy rates. For more information on differences in vacancy rates between the ACS and Census, see Comparing 2010 ACS & 2010 Census Occupancy, Vacancy, & Household Size on the Census website. Vacant – Current Residence Elsewhere Also known as a temporarily-occupied housing unit, a current residence elsewhere is a housing unit occupied at the time of interview entirely by people who will be there for 2 months or less. At sample units where all the people are staying less than 2 months, the respondent is asked a subset of the questions from the housing section, including the question In Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI), the data for current residence elsewhere were obtained after creating the roster of people staying at the sample unit and after asking the current residence questions. If it is determined that the housing unit is not the current residence of any household members, the CAPI instrument begins the battery of vacant housing unit questions. Beginning in 2013, in the Internet self-response instrument, the roster of people is not created. Rather, if no one is living or staying there for more than 2 months, it is established that the home is not the current residence of any household members and the instrument begins the battery of vacant housing questions. The current residence concept is unique to the American Community Survey (ACS). By using the current residence to decide for whom to collect survey information, the ACS can provide a more accurate description of an area’s social and economic characteristics. Most surveys, as well as the decennial census, use the concept of usual residence. Usual residence is defined as the place where a person lives and sleeps most of the time.

Vacant Housing Units See Living Quarters. Value The data on value (also referred to as “price asked” for vacant units) were obtained from Housing Question 19 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at housing units that were owned, being bought, vacant for sale, or sold but not occupied at the time of the survey. Value is the respondent's estimate of how much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the respondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house and the land. Owners of noncondominium multi-unit buildings who live in one of the building’s units, like duplexes and small apartment buildings, should report the value of the building, the land, and any additional buildings on the same plot of land. For vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. Value was tabulated separately for all owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale and sold, not occupied housing units, as well as owner-occupied mobile homes. The value of a home provides information on neighborhood quality, housing affordability, and wealth. These data provide socioeconomic information not captured by household income and comparative information on the state of local housing markets. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs designed to meet the housing needs of persons at different economic levels. Median and Quartile Value – The median divides the value distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median value of the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) and one-half above the median. Quartiles divide the value distribution into four equal parts. Median and quartile value are computed on the basis of a standard distribution.

From 1999-2007 the question provided 19 pre-coded response categories from “Less than $10,000” to “$250,000 or more – Specify.” Starting in 2004, value was shown for all owner-occupied housing units, unlike from 1996-2003 in which value was shown only for specified owner-occupied housing units. Changes introduced in 2008 were removing the pre-coded response categories and adding a write-in box for the respondent to enter the property value amount in dollars, and revising the wording of the question to ask, “About how much do you think this house and lot, apartment, or mobile home (and lot, if owned) would sell for if it were for sale?” Limitation of the Data – The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the value question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” in the search box. Comparability – Caution should be used when comparing ACS data on value (price asked) from the years 2008 and after with pre-2008 ACS data. Changes made to the value (price asked) question between the 2007 and 2008 ACS involving the response option may have resulted in an inconsistency in the value distribution for some areas. In 2007 and previous years, the ACS value question included categorical response options with a write-in for values over $250,000. Beginning in 2008, the response option became solely a write-in. Caution also should be used when comparing value (price asked) data from the ACS produced in 2008 or later with Census 2000 value data. The 2008 or later ACS provides solely a write-in response option while Census 2000 collected data in categories. Additionally, Census 2000 tables on value were released for both total owner-occupied housing units and specified owner-occupied housing units, thus comparisons can be made only when comparing the same universes between the two data sets.",

      "definition": "See Living Quarters. Value The data on value (also referred to as “price asked” for vacant units) were obtained from Housing Question 19 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at housing units that were owned, being bought, vacant for sale, or sold but not occupied at the time of the survey. Value is the respondent's estimate of how much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the respondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house and the land. Owners of noncondominium multi-unit buildings who live in one of the building’s units, like duplexes and small apartment buildings, should report the value of the building, the land, and any additional buildings on the same plot of land. For vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. Value was tabulated separately for all owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale and sold, not occupied housing units, as well as owner-occupied mobile homes. The value of a home provides information on neighborhood quality, housing affordability, and wealth. These data provide socioeconomic information not captured by household income and comparative information on the state of local housing markets. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs designed to meet the housing needs of persons at different economic levels. Median and Quartile Value – The median divides the value distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median value of the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) and one-half above the median. Quartiles divide the value distribution into four equal parts. Median and quartile value are computed on the basis of a standard distribution. (See the “Median Standard Distributions” section in Appendix A.) Median and quartile value calculations are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. Upper and lower quartiles can be used to note large value differences among various geographic areas. (For more information on medians and quartiles, see “Derived Measures.”) Aggregate Value (Price Asked) –Aggregate value (price asked) is calculated by adding all of the value estimates for owner occupied housing units in an area (and all the prices asked for vacant-for-sale and sold, not occupied housing units in an area). Aggregate value (price asked) is rounded to the nearest hundred dollars.

Vehicles Available The data on vehicles available were obtained from Housing Question 12 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at occupied housing units. These data show the number of passenger cars, vans, and pickup or panel trucks of one-ton (2,000 pounds) capacity or less kept at home and available for the use of household members. Vehicles rented or leased for one month or more, company vehicles, and police and government vehicles are included if kept at home and used for non-business purposes. Motorcycles or other recreational vehicles are excluded. Dismantled or immobile vehicles are excluded. Vehicles kept at home but used only for business purposes also are excluded. The availability of vehicles provides information for numerous transportation programs. When the data is used in conjunction with place-of-work and journey-to-work data, the information can provide insight into vehicle travel and aid in forecasting future travel and its effect on transportation systems. The data also serve to aid in the development of emergency and evacuation planning, special transportation services, and forecasting future energy consumption and needs. Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided a space for the respondent to enter the number of vehicles. Since 1999, the American Community Survey question provided seven pre-coded response categories ranging from “None” to “6 or more.” Comparability – Data on vehicle availability in the 2023 ACS can be compared to previous ACS and Census 2000 vehicle availability data. Year Householder Moved into Unit The data on year householder moved into unit were obtained from answers to Housing Question 3 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS), which was asked at occupied housing units. These data refer to the year of the latest move by the householder. If the householder moved back into a housing unit he or she previously occupied, the year of the latest move was reported. If the householder moved from one apartment to another within the same building, the year the householder moved into the present apartment was reported. The intent is to establish the year the present occupancy by the householder began. The year that the householder moved in is not necessarily the same year other members of the household moved in, although in the great majority of cases an entire household moves at the same time. The year the householder moved into the unit provides information on the specific period of time when mobility occurs, especially for recent movers. These data help to measure neighborhood stability and to identify transient communities. The data also is used to assess the amount of displacement caused by floods and other natural disasters, and as an aid to evaluate the changes in service requirements. Median Year Householder Moved into Unit – Median year householder moved into unit divides the distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median year householder moved into unit and one-half above the median. Median year householder moved into unit is computed on the basis of a standard distribution. (See the “Median Standard Distributions” section in Appendix A.) Median year householder moved into unit is rounded to the nearest calendar year. (For more information on medians, see “Derived Measures.”) Question/Concept History – Since 1996, the question provided two write-in spaces for the respondent to enter month and year the householder (person 1) moved into the house, apartment, or mobile home. Comparability – Data on year householder moved into unit in the 2023 ACS can be compared to previous ACS and Census 2000 year householder moved into unit data. Year Structure Built The data on year structure built were obtained from Housing Question 2 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at both occupied and vacant housing units. Year structure built refers to when the building was first constructed, not when it was remodeled, added to, or converted. Housing units under construction are included as vacant housing if they meet the housing unit definition, that is, all exterior windows, doors, and final usable floors are in place. For mobile homes, houseboats, RVs, etc., the manufacturer's model year was assumed to be the year built. The data relate to the number of units built during the specified periods that were still in existence at the time of interview. The year the structure was built provides information on the age of housing units. These data help identify new housing construction and measures the disappearance of old housing from the inventory, when used in combination with data from previous years. The data also serve to aid in the development of formulas to determine substandard housing and provide assistance in forecasting future services, such as energy consumption and fire protection. Median Year Structure Built – Median year structure built divides the distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median year structure built and one-half above the median. Median year structure built is computed on the basis of a standard distribution. (See the “Median Standard Distributions” section in Appendix A.) The median is rounded to the nearest calendar year. Median age of housing can be obtained by subtracting median year structure built from survey year. For example, if the median year structure built is 1969, the median age of housing in that area is 49 years (2018 minus 1969). (For more information on medians, see “Derived Measures.”) Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided a write-in space for the respondent to enter a year the structure was built.

Population Variables Ability to Speak English Respondent’s Ability to Speak English – Respondents who reported speaking a language other than English (question 14a in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS)) were asked to indicate their English-speaking ability (question 14c in the 2023 ACS) based on one of the following categories: “Very well,” “Well,” “Not well,” or “Not at all.” Those who answered “Well,” “Not well,” or “Not at all” are sometimes referred to as “Less than ‘very well.’” Respondents were not instructed on how to interpret the response categories in this question. Limited English speaking households- This variable identifies households that may need English-language assistance. A “Limited English speaking household” is one in which no member 14 years old and over (1) speaks only English at home or (2) speaks a language other than English at home and speaks English “Very well.” After data are collected for each person in the household, the limited English-speaking household variable is calculated by checking if all people 14 years old and older speak a language other than English. If so, the calculation checks the English-speaking ability responses to see if all people 14 years old and older speak English “Less than ‘very well.’” If all household members 14 and over speak a language other than English and speak English “Less than ‘very well,’” the household is considered part of this group that may be in need of English language assistance. All members of a household are included in this group, including members under 14 years old who may speak only English or speak a language other than English at home and speak English “Very well.” Government agencies use information on language spoken at home and ability to speak English for their programs that serve the needs of those who have difficulty with English. Under the Voting Rights Act, data on language are necessary to meet statutory requirements for making voting materials available in minority languages. This Act directs the Census Bureau, using data about language spoken at home and the ability to speak English, to identify minority groups that speak a language other than English and to assess their English- speaking ability. The U.S. Department of Education uses the language data to prepare a report to Congress on the social and economic status of children served by different local school districts. State and local agencies concerned with aging develop health care and other services tailored to the language and cultural diversity of the elderly under the Older Americans Act. Question/Concept History – The English Language Ability question has been the same since the beginning of the ACS. “Limited English-speaking households” has been calculated the same way in all years of ACS data collection, but has sometimes been termed “Linguistic Isolation” or “Households in which no one 14 and over speaks English only or speaks a language other than English and speaks English ‘Very Well.’” Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have ability to speak English distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the ability to speak English distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. Ideally, the data on ability to speak English represented a person’s perception of their own English-speaking ability. However, because one household member usually completes ACS questionnaires, the responses may have represented the perception of another household member. Comparability – Caution should be taken when comparing language data from the ACS and 1980, 1990, and 2000 Censuses across time. Methodological changes to data collection in 2013 may have affected language data. Users should be aware of these changes when comparing data from 2013 or after to data from before 2013, or when using multi-year ACS data containing data from before and after 2013. For more information on comparability of language data, see the user note, “2013 Language Estimates.” Though the term “Linguistic Isolation” is no longer used, data under this heading were tabulated in the same way as data under the heading “Limited English speaking households” or “Households in which no one 14 and over speaks English only or speaks a language other than English and speaks English ‘Very well.’” Age The data on age were derived from answers to Question 4 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The age classification is based on the age of the person in complete years at the time of interview. Both age and date of birth are used in combination to calculate the most accurate age at the time of the interview. Respondents are asked to give an age in whole, completed years as of interview date as well as the month, day and year of birth. People are not to round an age up if the person is close to having a birthday. They can estimate an age if the exact age is not known. For babies less than 1 year old, respondents are asked not to write the age in months, but to write 0 as the age. Inconsistently reported and missing values are assigned or imputed based on the values of other variables for that person, from other people in the household, or from people in other households (“hot deck” imputation). Age is asked for all persons in a household or group quarters. On the mailout/mailback paper questionnaire for households, both age and date of birth are asked for persons listed as person numbers 1-5 on the form. Only age (in years) is initially asked for persons listed as 6-12 on the mailout/mailback paper questionnaire. If a respondent indicates that there are more than",

If so, the calculation checks the English-speaking ability responses to see if all people 14 years old and older speak English “Less than ‘very well.’” If all household members 14 and over speak a language other than English and speak English “Less than ‘very well,’” the household is considered part of this group that may be in need of English language assistance. All members of a household are included in this group, including members under 14 years old who may speak only English or speak a language other than English at home and speak English “Very well.” Government agencies use information on language spoken at home and ability to speak English for their programs that serve the needs of those who have difficulty with English. Under the Voting Rights Act, data on language are necessary to meet statutory requirements for making voting materials available in minority languages. This Act directs the Census Bureau, using data about language spoken at home and the ability to speak English, to identify minority groups that speak a language other than English and to assess their English- speaking ability. The U.S. Department of Education uses the language data to prepare a report to Congress on the social and economic status of children served by different local school districts. State and local agencies concerned with aging develop health care and other services tailored to the language and cultural diversity of the elderly under the Older Americans Act. Question/Concept History – The English Language Ability question has been the same since the beginning of the ACS. “Limited English-speaking households” has been calculated the same way in all years of ACS data collection, but has sometimes been termed “Linguistic Isolation” or “Households in which no one 14 and over speaks English only or speaks a language other than English and speaks English ‘Very Well.’” Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have ability to speak English distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the ability to speak English distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. Ideally, the data on ability to speak English represented a person’s perception of their own English-speaking ability. However, because one household member usually completes ACS questionnaires, the responses may have represented the perception of another household member. Comparability – Caution should be taken when comparing language data from the ACS and 1980, 1990, and 2000 Censuses across time. Methodological changes to data collection in 2013 may have affected language data. Users should be aware of these changes when comparing data from 2013 or after to data from before 2013, or when using multi-year ACS data containing data from before and after 2013. For more information on comparability of language data, see the user note, “2013 Language Estimates.” Though the term “Linguistic Isolation” is no longer used, data under this heading were tabulated in the same way as data under the heading “Limited English speaking households” or “Households in which no one 14 and over speaks English only or speaks a language other than English and speaks English ‘Very well.’” Age The data on age were derived from answers to Question 4 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The age classification is based on the age of the person in complete years at the time of interview. Both age and date of birth are used in combination to calculate the most accurate age at the time of the interview. Respondents are asked to give an age in whole, completed years as of interview date as well as the month, day and year of birth. People are not to round an age up if the person is close to having a birthday. They can estimate an age if the exact age is not known. For babies less than 1 year old, respondents are asked not to write the age in months, but to write 0 as the age. Inconsistently reported and missing values are assigned or imputed based on the values of other variables for that person, from other people in the household, or from people in other households (“hot deck” imputation). Age is asked for all persons in a household or group quarters. On the mailout/mailback paper questionnaire for households, both age and date of birth are asked for persons listed as person numbers 1-5 on the form. Only age (in years) is initially asked for persons listed as 6-12 on the mailout/mailback paper questionnaire. If a respondent indicates that there are more than",

Only age (in years) is initially asked for persons listed as 6-12 on the mailout/mailback paper questionnaire. If a respondent indicates that there are more than 5 people living in the household, then telephone center staffers call respondents to obtain date of birth data for the additional household members during the Failed Edit Follow-up (FEFU) operation. In the Internet and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments, both age and date of birth are collected for all persons. Date of birth is asked first, so that the instruments can calculate age from that information. Respondents are then asked to confirm that the calculated age is correct. In 2006, the ACS began collecting data in group quarters (GQs). This included asking both age and date of birth for persons living in a group quarters. For additional data collection methodology, please go to https://www.census.gov/programs- surveys/acs/. Data on age are used to determine the applicability of other questions for a particular individual and to classify other characteristics in tabulations. Age data are needed to interpret most social and economic characteristics used to plan and analyze programs and policies. Age is central for any number of federal programs that target funds or services to children, working-age adults, females of childbearing age, or the older population. The U.S. Department of Education uses census age data in its formula for allotment to states. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs uses age to develop its mandated state projections on the need for hospitals, nursing homes, cemeteries, domiciliary services, and other benefits for veterans. For more information on the use of age data in Federal programs, please go to “ACS Handbook of Questions and Current Federal Uses”. Median Age – The median age is the age that divides the population into two equal-size groups. Half of the population is older than the median age and half is younger. Median age is based on a standard distribution of the population by single years of age and is shown to the nearest tenth of a year. (See the sections on “Standard Distributions” and “Medians” under “Derived Measures.”) Age Dependency Ratio – The age dependency ratio is derived by dividing the combined under 18 years and 65 years and over populations by the 18-to-64 population and multiplying by 100. Old-Age Dependency Ratio – The old-age dependency ratio is derived by dividing the population 65 years and over by the 18-to-64 population and multiplying by 100. Child Dependency Ratio – The child dependency ratio is derived by dividing the population under 18 years by the 18-to-64 population and multiplying by 100. Question/Concept History – The 1996-2002 ACS question asked for month, day, and year of birth before age. Since 2003, the ACS question asked for age, followed by month, day, and year of birth. In 2008, an additional instruction was provided with the age and date of birth question on the ACS questionnaire to report babies as age 0 when the child was less than 1 year old. The addition of this instruction occurred after 2005 National Census Test results indicated increased accuracy of age reporting for babies less than one year old. In 2020, the instruction for babies less than one year old was edited to ask respondents not to write the age in months, but to write 0 as the age. This was a result of cognitive testing in 2014 and 2015, which indicated the revised wording was clearer for Spanish-speaking respondents. Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population living in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS population universe. Some types of group quarters have populations with age distributions that are very different from that of the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the age distribution for a given geographic area. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. For example, in areas with large colleges and universities, the percent of individuals 18-24 would increase due to the inclusion of GQs in the ACS universe. Comparability – Caution should be taken when comparing population in age groups across time. The entire population continually ages into older age groups over time, and babies fill in the youngest age group. Therefore, the population of a certain age is made up of a completely different group of people in one time period than in another (e.g. one age group in 2000 versus same age group in 2015). Since populations occasionally experience booms/increases and busts/decreases in births, deaths, or migration (for example, the postwar Baby Boom from 1946-1964), one should not necessarily expect that the population in an age group in one year should be similar in size or proportion to the population in the same age group in a different period in time. For example, Baby Boomers were age 36 to 54 in Census 2000 while they were age 56 to 74 in the 2020 ACS. The age structure and distribution would therefore shift in those age groups to reflect the change in people occupying those age- specific groups over time. Data users should also be aware of methodology differences that may exist between different data sources if they are comparing ACS age data to other data sources, such as Population Estimates or Decennial Census data. For example, ACS data are that of a respondent-based survey and subject to various quality measures, such as sampling and nonsampling error, response rates, and item allocation error. This differs in design and methodology from other data sources, such as Population Estimates, which is not a survey and involves computational methodology to derive intercensal estimates of the population. While ACS estimates are controlled to Population Estimates for age at the nation, state and county levels of geography as part of the ACS weighting procedure, variation may exist in the age structure of a population at lower levels of geography when comparing different time periods or comparing across time due to the absence of controls below the county geography level. For more information on ACS data accuracy and weighting procedures, please go to https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/. It also should be noted that although the ACS produces population, demographic, and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. Ancestry Ancestry refers to a person’s ethnic origin, heritage, descent, or “roots,” which may reflect their place of birth or that of previous generations of their family. Some ethnic identities, such as “Egyptian” or “Polish” can be traced to geographic areas outside the United States, while other ethnicities such as “Pennsylvania German” or “Cajun” evolved in the United States. The intent of the ancestry question was not to measure the degree of attachment the respondent had to a particular ethnicity, but simply to establish that the respondent had a connection to and self-identified with a particular ethnic group. For example, a response of “Irish” might reflect total involvement in an Irish community or only a memory of ancestors several generations removed from the individual. The data on ancestry were derived from answers to Question 13 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was based on self-identification; the data on ancestry represent self-classification by people according to the ancestry group(s) with which they most closely identify. The ancestry question is asked for every person in the ACS, regardless of age, place of birth, Hispanic origin, or race. The Census Bureau coded the responses into a numeric representation of over 1,000 categories. To do so, responses initially were processed through an automated coding system; then, those that were not automatically assigned a code were coded by individuals trained in coding ancestry responses. To see the code list for this year and previous years, see the Code Lists, Definitions, and Accuracy page. The ancestry question allowed respondents to report one or more ancestry groups. Generally, only the first two responses reported were coded. If a response was in terms of a dual ancestry, for example, “Irish English,” the person was assigned two codes, in this case one for Irish and another for English. However, in certain cases, multiple responses such as “French Canadian,” “Scotch-Irish,” “Greek Cypriot,” were assigned a single code reflecting their status as unique groups. If a person reported one of these unique groups in addition to another group, for example, “Scotch-Irish English,” resulting in three terms, that person received one code for the unique group (Scotch-Irish) and another one for the remaining group (English). If a person reported “English Irish French,” only English and Irish were coded. If there were more than two ancestries listed and one of the ancestries was a part of another, such as “German Bavarian Hawaiian,” the responses were coded using the more detailed groups (Bavarian and Hawaiian). The ACS editing system uses answers to the race and place of birth questions to clarify ancestry responses of “Indian,” where possible. It also aids in the interpretation of two-word ancestries. The Census Bureau accepted “American” as a unique ethnicity if it was given alone or with one other ancestry. There were some groups such as “American Indian,” “Mexican American,” and “African American” that were coded and identified separately. In all tabulations, when respondents provided an unclassifiable ethnic identity (for example, “multi-national,” “adopted,” or “I have no idea”), the answer was included in “Unclassified or not reported.” Ancestry identifies the ethnic origins of the population, and federal agencies regard this information as essential for fulfilling many important needs. Ancestry is required to enforce provisions under the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based upon race, sex, religion, and national origin. More generally, these data are needed to measure the social and economic characteristics of ethnic groups and to tailor services to accommodate cultural differences. The Department of Labor draws samples for surveys that provide employment statistics and other related information for ethnic groups using ancestry. The ACS data on ancestry are released annually on https://data.census.gov the Census Bureau’s online data dissemination platform. Detailed Tables B04004-B04006 contain estimates of over 100 different ancestry groups for the nation, states, and many other geographic areas. Table B04007 provides information on the number of people who did not report an ancestry. The Special Population Profiles (SPPs) contain characteristics of different ancestry groups. To find these tables, go to https://data.census.gov and select “Advanced Search” to enter the table number. Or, to view characteristics of a group or groups, go to “People and Populations,” then “Ancestry” to select individual ancestry groups. Select Table S0201 to view the SPP. The following are the types of estimates shown: People Reporting Single Ancestry (B04004) – Includes all people who reported only one ethnic group such as “German.” Also included in this category are people with only a multiple-term response such as “Scotch-Irish” who are assigned a single code because they represent one distinct group. For example, in this type of table, the count for German would be interpreted as “The number of people who reported only German as their ancestry.” People Reporting Multiple Ancestries (B04005) – Includes all people who reported more than one group, such as “German” and “Irish” and were assigned two ancestry codes. The German line on this table would be interpreted as “The number of people who responded that German was part of their multiple ancestry.” People Reporting Ancestry (B04006) – Includes all people who reported each ancestry, regardless of whether it was their first or second ancestry, or part of a single or multiple response. This estimate is the sum of the two estimates above (for Single and Multiple ancestry). People can be listed twice in this table. For example, if someone reports their ancestry as “German and Danish,” they will be listed once in German and once in Danish, and therefore the sum of the rows would not equal the total population. Interpret the German line of this table as “The total number of people who reported they had German ancestry.”",

Children Ever Born For the 1996-1998 American Community Survey (ACS), the data on fertility (also referred to as “children ever born”) was asked of all women 15 years old and over regardless of marital status. Stillbirths, stepchildren, and adopted children were excluded from the number of children ever born. Ever-married women were instructed to include all children born to them before and during their most recent marriage, children no longer living, and children living away from home, as well as children who were still living in the home. Never-married women were instructed to include all children born to them. The question on children ever born was asked to measure lifetime fertility experience of women up to the survey date. Data were most frequently presented in terms of the aggregate number of children ever born to women in the specified category and in terms of the rate per 1,000 women. Beginning in 1999, ACS data on fertility were derived from questions that asked if the person had given birth in the past 12 months (Question 25 in the 2023 ACS). See the section on “Fertility” for more information. Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS used a write-in space for the number and a response category for “None.” No question addressed “children ever born” after 1998. Limitation of the Data – The data available for 1996-1998 are only available for a limited number of geographies. Comparability – The data on children ever born are comparable to data from the 1990 Census and prior censuses. The data are also comparable to the June supplement to the Current Population Survey. Citizen Voting-Age Population The citizen voting-age population includes all United States citizen 18 years of age or older at the time of the interview. Data on the citizen voting-age population is derived using the data on age and citizenship status. See Age and Citizenship Status for information on these topics. Citizenship Status (U.S. Citizenship Status) The data on citizenship status were derived from answers to Question 8 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). This question was asked about Persons 1 through 5 in the ACS. Respondents were asked to select one of five categories: (1) born in the United States; (2) born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or Northern Marianas; (3) born abroad of U.S. citizen parent or parents; (4) U.S. citizen by naturalization; or (5) not a U.S. citizen. Respondents indicating they were a U.S. citizen by naturalization were asked to print their year of naturalization. For the Puerto Rico Community Survey, respondents were asked to select one of five categories: (1) born in Puerto Rico; (2) born in a U.S. state, District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or Northern Marianas; (3) born abroad of U.S. citizen parent or parents; (4) U.S. citizen by naturalization; or (5) not a U.S. citizen. Respondents indicating they were a U.S. citizen by naturalization were asked to print their year of naturalization. When no information on citizenship status was reported for a person, information for other household members, if available, was used to assign a citizenship status to the respondent. All cases of nonresponse that were not assigned a citizenship status based on information from other household members were allocated the citizenship status of another person with similar characteristics who provided complete information. In cases of conflicting responses, place of birth information was used to edit citizenship status. For example, if a respondent stated he or she was born in Puerto Rico but was not a U.S. citizen, the edits used the response to the place of birth question to change the respondent’s status to “U.S. citizen at birth.” U.S. Citizen – Respondents who indicated that they were born in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Marianas, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as those born abroad",

This includes respondents who indicated they were a U.S. citizen by naturalization or not a U.S. citizen. The ACS questionnaires do not ask about immigration status. The population surveyed includes all people who indicated that the United States was their usual place of residence on the survey date. The foreign-born population includes naturalized U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents (i.e. immigrants), temporary migrants (e.g., foreign students), humanitarian migrants (e.g., refugees), and unauthorized migrants (i.e. people illegally present in the United States). The responses to this question are used to determine the U.S. citizen and non-U.S. citizen populations as well as to determine the native and foreign-born populations. Question/Concept History – In the 1996-1998 ACS, the third response category was “Yes, born abroad of American parent(s).” However, in 1999 for the ACS and 2005 for the Puerto Rico Community Survey, the response category was then changed to “Yes, born abroad of American parent or parents.” In 2008, respondents who indicated that they were a U.S. citizen by naturalization were asked to print their year of naturalization. Also in 2008, modifications in wording were made to both the third response category (changed from “Yes, born abroad of American parent or parents” to “Yes, born abroad of U.S. citizen parent or parents”) and the fifth response category (changed from “No, not a citizen of the United States” to “No, not a U.S. citizen”). Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have citizenship status distributions that are different from those of the household population. Consequently, the inclusion of the GQ population may have a noticeable impact on the overall citizenship status distribution. This is particularly true for areas with substantial GQ populations.",

Citizenship Status (U.S. Citizenship Status) The data on citizenship status were derived from answers to Question 8 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). This question was asked about Persons 1 through 5 in the ACS. Respondents were asked to select one of five categories: (1) born in the United States; (2) born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or Northern Marianas; (3) born abroad of U.S. citizen parent or parents; (4) U.S. citizen by naturalization; or (5) not a U.S. citizen. Respondents indicating they were a U.S. citizen by naturalization were asked to print their year of naturalization. For the Puerto Rico Community Survey, respondents were asked to select one of five categories: (1) born in Puerto Rico; (2) born in a U.S. state, District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or Northern Marianas; (3) born abroad of U.S. citizen parent or parents; (4) U.S. citizen by naturalization; or (5) not a U.S. citizen. Respondents indicating they were a U.S. citizen by naturalization were asked to print their year of naturalization. When no information on citizenship status was reported for a person, information for other household members, if available, was used to assign a citizenship status to the respondent. All cases of nonresponse that were not assigned a citizenship status based on information from other household members were allocated the citizenship status of another person with similar characteristics who provided complete information. In cases of conflicting responses, place of birth information was used to edit citizenship status. For example, if a respondent stated he or she was born in Puerto Rico but was not a U.S. citizen, the edits used the response to the place of birth question to change the respondent’s status to “U.S. citizen at birth.” U.S. Citizen – Respondents who indicated that they were born in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Marianas, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as those born abroad of at least one U.S. citizen parent are considered U.S. citizens at birth. Foreign-born people who indicated that they were U.S. citizens through naturalization also are considered U.S. citizens.

      "label": "DISABILITY STATUS",
      "definition": "Under the conceptual framework of disability described by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF), disability is defined as the product of interactions among individuals’ bodies; their physical, emotional, and mental health; and the physical and social environment in which they live, work, or play. Disability exists where this interaction results in limitations of activities and restrictions to full participation at school, at work, at home, or in the community. For example, disability may exist where a child has difficulty learning because the school cannot accommodate the child’s deafness. Furthermore, disability is a dynamic concept that changes over time as one’s health improves or declines, as technology advances, and as social structures adapt. As such, disability is a continuum in which the degree of difficulty may also increase or decrease. Because disability exists along a continuum, various cut-offs are used to allow for a simpler understanding of the concept, the most common of which is the dichotomous “With a disability”/“no disability” categorization. Measuring this complex concept of disability with a short set of six questions is difficult. Because of the multitude of possible functional limitations that may present as disabilities, and in the absence of information on external factors that influence disability, surveys like the ACS are limited to capturing difficulty with only selected activities. Thus, people identified by the ACS as having a disability are those who report difficulty with specific functions, and may, in the absence of accommodation, have a disability. While this definition is different from the one described by the IOM and ICF conceptual frameworks, it relates to the programmatic definitions used in most Federal and state legislation. In an attempt to capture a variety of characteristics that encompass the definition of disability, the ACS identifies serious difficulty with four basic areas of functioning – hearing, vision, cognition, and ambulation. These functional limitations are supplemented by questions about difficulties with selected activities from the Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales, namely difficulty bathing and dressing, and difficulty performing errands such as shopping. Overall, the ACS attempts to capture six aspects of disability, which can be used together to create an overall disability measure, or independently to identify populations with specific disability types. Information on disability is used by a number of federal agencies to distribute funds and develop programs for people with disabilities. For example, data about the size, distribution, and needs of the population with a disability are essential for developing disability employment policy. For the Americans with Disabilities Act, data about functional limitations are important to ensure that comparable public transportation services are available for all segments of the population. Federal grants are awarded, under the Older Americans Act, based on the number of older adults with physical and mental disabilities. Question/Concept History – In the current ACS, disability concepts are asked in questions 18 through 20. Question 18 has two subparts and is asked of all persons regardless of age. Question 19 has three subparts and is asked of people age 5 years and older. Question 20 is asked of people age 15 years and older. Hearing difficulty is derived from question 18a, which asks respondents if they are “deaf or … have serious difficulty hearing.” Vision difficulty is derived from question 18b, which asks respondents if they are “blind or … have serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses.” Prior to the 2008 ACS, hearing and vision difficulty were asked in a single question under the label “Sensory disability.” Cognitive difficulty is derived from question 19a, which asks respondents if due to physical, mental, or emotional condition, they have “serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions.” Prior to the 2008 ACS, the question on cognitive functioning asked about difficulty “learning, remembering, or concentrating” under the label “Mental disability.” Ambulatory difficulty is derived from question 19b, which asks respondents if they have “serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs.” Prior to 2008, the ACS asked if respondents had “a condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical activities such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying.” This measure was labeled “Physical difficulty” in ACS data products. Self-care difficulty is derived from question 19c, which asks respondents if they have “difficulty dressing or bathing.” Difficulty with these activities are two of six specific Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) often used by health care providers to assess patients’ self- care needs. Prior to the 2008 ACS, the question on self-care limitations asked about difficulty “dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home,” under the label “Self-care disability.” Independent living difficulty is derived from question 20, which asks respondents if due to a physical, mental, or emotional condition, they have difficulty “doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor’s office or shopping.” Difficulty with this activity is one of several Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) used by health care providers in making care decisions. Prior to the 2008 ACS, a similar measure on difficulty “going outside the home alone to shop or visit a doctor’s office” was asked under the label “Go-outside-home disability.” children under 5 years old, hearing and vision difficulty are used to determine disability hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory, and self-care difficulties. For people aged 15 years and older, they are considered to have a disability if they have difficulty with any one of the six difficulty types. Limitation of the Data – The universe for most disability data tabulations is the civilian noninstitutionalized population. Some types of GQ populations have disability distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the noninstitutionalized GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the disability distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial noninstitutionalized GQ population. For a Disability Prevalence Among the Civilian Noninstitutionalized and Total Populations in the American Community Survey”. Comparability – The ACS disability estimates are comparable for data years 2008 and for subsequent years. Beginning in 2008, questions on disability represent a conceptual and empirical break from earlier years of the ACS. Hence, the Census Bureau does not recommend any comparisons of ACS disability data from 2008 or later years with estimates from 2007 and earlier years. Research suggests that combining the new separate measures of hearing and vision difficulty to generate a sensory difficulty measure does not create a comparable estimate to the prior sensory disability estimates in previous ACS products. Likewise, the cognitive difficulty, ambulatory difficulty, self-care difficulty, and independent living difficulty measures are based on different sets of activities and different question wordings from similar measures in ACS questionnaires prior to 2008 and thus should not be compared. Because the overall these estimates should also not be compared to prior years. For additional information on the differences between the ACS disability questions beginning in 2008 and prior ACS disability questions, see “Review of Changes to the Measurement of Disability in the 2008 American Community Survey”. Disability estimates for 2008 and subsequent years also should not be compared with disability estimates from Census 2000 for reasons similar to the ones noted above. ACS disability estimates also should not be compared with more detailed measures of disability, such as the National Health Interview Survey and the Survey of Income and Program Participation. Educational Attainment Educational attainment data are needed for use in assessing the socioeconomic condition of the U.S. population. Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation. These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. Based on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school. Data on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2023 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received. The educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” Respondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some college” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course work may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree. Master’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Professional school degrees may include those in medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported. Help text available to people responding by Internet and through personal interviews were instructed that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported. High School Graduate or Higher – This category includes people whose highest degree was a high school diploma or its equivalent, people who attended college but did not receive a degree, and people who received an associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, or professional or doctorate degree. People who reported completing the 12th grade but not receiving a diploma are not included. Not Enrolled, Not High School Graduate – This category includes people of compulsory school attendance age or above who were not enrolled in school and were not high school graduates. These people may be referred to as “high school dropouts.” There is no restriction on when they “dropped out” of school; therefore, they may have dropped out before high school and never attended high school. Question/Concept History – Since 1999, the ACS question does not have the response category for “Vocational, technical, or business school degree” that the 1996-1998 ACS question had. Starting in 1999, the ACS question had two categories for some college: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year” and “1 or more years of college, no degree.” The 1996-1998 ACS question had one category: “Some college but no degree.” In the 1996-1998 ACS, the educational attainment question was used to estimate level of enrollment.

Since 1999, a question regarding grade of enrollment was included. The 1999-2007 ACS attainment question grouped grade categories below high school into the following three categories: “Nursery school to 4th grade,” “5th grade or 6th grade,” and “7th grade or 8th grade.” The 1996-1998 ACS question allowed a write-in for highest grade completed for grades 1-11 in addition to “Nursery or preschool” and “Kindergarten.” Beginning in 2008, the ACS attainment question was changed to the following categories for levels up to Grade 12, no diploma: “Nursery school,” “Kindergarten,” “Grade 1 through grade 11,” and “12th grade, no diploma.” The survey question allowed a write-in for the highest grade completed for grades 1-11. In addition, the category that was previously “High school graduate (including GED)” was broken into two categories: “Regular high school diploma” and “GED or alternative credential.” The term “credit” for the two some college categories was emphasized. The phrase “beyond a bachelor’s degree” was added to the professional degree category. Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the educational attainment question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Comparability – New questions were added to the 2008 ACS Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments. Respondents who received a high school diploma, GED or equivalent also were asked if they had completed any college credit. Therefore, data users may notice a decrease in the number of high school graduates relative to previous years because those people are now being captured in the “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” or “1 or more years of college credit, no degree” categories. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Current Population Survey (CPS). ACS data are generally comparable to data from the Census. For more information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data, please see the attainment/guidance/factsheet-acs-cps.html. More information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data can also be found in the paper “Comparison of ACS and ASEC Data on Employment Status The data on employment status were derived from Questions 30 and 36 to 38 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). (In the 1999-2002 ACS, data were derived from Questions 22 and 28 to 30; in the 1996-1998 ACS, data were derived from Questions 21 and 28 to 30.) The questions were asked of all people 15 years old and over. The series of questions on employment status was designed to identify, in this sequence: (1) people who worked at any time during the reference week; (2) people on temporary layoff who were available for work; (3) people who did not work during the reference week but who had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent (excluding layoff); (4) people who did not work during the reference week, but who were looking for work during the last four weeks and were available for work during the reference week; and (5) people not in the labor force. (For more information, see the discussion under “Reference Week.”) The employment status data shown in ACS tabulations relate to people 16 years old and over. Employment status is key to understanding work and unemployment patterns and the availability of workers. Based on labor market areas and unemployment levels, the U.S. Department of Labor identifies service delivery areas and determines amounts to be allocated to each for job training. The impact of immigration on the economy and job markets is determined partially by labor force data, and this information is included in required reports to Congress. The Office of Management and Budget, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, uses data about employed workers as part of the criteria for defining metropolitan areas. The Bureau of Economic Analysis uses this information, in conjunction with other data, to develop its state per capita income estimates used in the allocation formulas and eligibility criteria for many federal programs such as Medicaid. Employed – This category includes all civilians 16 years old and over who either (1) were “at work,” that is, those who did any work at all during the reference week as paid employees, worked in their own business or profession, worked on their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers on a family farm or in a family business; or (2) were “with a job but not at work,” that is, those who did not work during the reference week but had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent due to illness, bad weather, industrial dispute, vacation, or other personal reasons. Excluded from the employed are people whose only activity consisted of work around the house or unpaid volunteer work for religious, charitable, and similar organizations; also excluded are all institutionalized people and people on active duty in the United States Armed Forces. Civilian Employed – This term is defined exactly the same as the term “employed” above. Unemployed – All civilians 16 years old and over are classified as unemployed if they (1) were neither “at work” nor “with a job but not at work” during the reference week, and (2) were actively looking for work during the last 4 weeks, and (3) were available to start a job. Also included as unemployed are civilians who did not work at all during the reference week, were waiting to be called back to a job from which they had been laid off, and were available for work except for temporary illness. Examples of job seeking activities are: • Registering at a public or private employment office • Meeting with prospective employers • Investigating possibilities for starting a professional practice or opening a business • Placing or answering advertisements • Writing letters of application • Being on a union or professional register Civilian Labor Force – Consists of people classified as employed or unemployed in accordance with the criteria described above. Unemployment Rate – The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the civilian labor force. For example, if the civilian labor force equals 100 people and 7 people are unemployed, then the unemployment rate would be 7 percent. Labor Force – All people classified in the civilian labor force plus members of the U.S. Armed Forces (people on active duty with the United States Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard). Labor Force Participation Rate – The labor force participation rate represents the proportion of the population that is in the labor force. For example, if there are 100 people in the population 16 years and over, and 64 of them are in the labor force, then the labor force participation rate for the population 16 years and over would be 64 percent. Not in Labor Force – All people 16 years old and over who are not classified as members of the labor force. This category consists mainly of students, homemakers, retired workers, seasonal workers interviewed in an off season who were not looking for work, institutionalized people, and people doing only incidental unpaid family work (less than 15 hours during the reference week). Worker – This term appears in connection with several subjects: employment status, journey-to-work questions, class of worker, weeks worked in the past 12 months, and number of workers in family in the past 12 months. The meaning varies and, therefore, should be determined in each case by referring to the definition of the subject in which it appears. When used in the concepts “workers in family” and “full-time, year-round workers,” the term “worker” relates to the meaning of work defined for the “work experience” subject.

(For more information, see the discussion under “Reference Week.”) availability of workers. Based on labor market areas and unemployment levels, the U.S. Department of Labor identifies service delivery areas and determines amounts to be allocated to each for job training. The impact of immigration on the economy and job markets is determined partially by labor force data, and this information is included in required reports to Congress. The Office of Management and Budget, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, uses data about employed workers as part of the criteria for defining metropolitan areas. The Bureau of Economic Analysis uses this information, in conjunction with other data, to develop its state per capita income estimates used in the allocation formulas and eligibility criteria for many federal programs such as Medicaid. Employed – This category includes all civilians 16 years old and over who either (1) were “at work,” that is, those who did any work at all during the reference week as paid employees, worked in their own business or profession, worked on their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers on a family farm or in a family business; or (2) were “with a job but not at work,” that is, those who did not work during the reference week but had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent due to illness, bad weather, industrial dispute, vacation, or other personal reasons. Excluded from the employed are people whose only activity consisted of work around the house or unpaid volunteer work for religious, charitable, and similar organizations; also excluded are all institutionalized people and people on active duty in the United States Armed Forces. Civilian Employed – This term is defined exactly the same as the term “employed” above. Unemployed – All civilians 16 years old and over are classified as unemployed if they (1) were neither “at work” nor “with a job but not at work” during the reference week, and (2) were actively looking for work during the last 4 weeks, and (3) were available to start a job.

Question/Concept History – Worked Last Week (Question 30 in the 2023 ACS): From 1999-2007, an italicized instruction was added to the question to help respondents determine what to count as work. Starting in 2008, the instruction was removed and the question was separated into two parts in an effort to give respondents – particularly people with irregular kinds of work arrangements – two opportunities to grasp and respond to the correct intent of the question. On Layoff (Question 36a in the 2023 ACS): Starting in 1999, the “Yes, on temporary layoff from most recent job” and “Yes, permanently laid off from most recent job” response categories were condensed into a single “Yes” category. An additional question (Q36b) was added to determine the temporary/permanent layoff distinction. Temporarily Absent (Question 36b in the 2023 ACS): Starting in 2008, the temporarily absent question included a revised list of examples of work absences. Recalled to Work (Question 36c in the 2023 ACS): This question was added in the 1999 ACS to determine if a respondent who reported being on layoff from a job had been informed that he or she would be recalled to work within 6 months or been given a date to return to work. Looking for Work (Question 37 in the 2023 ACS): Starting in 2008, the actively looking for work question was modified to emphasize ‘active’ job-searching activities. Available to Work (Question 38 in the 2023 ACS): Starting in 1999, the “Yes, if a job had been offered” and “Yes, if recalled from layoff” response categories were condensed into one category, “Yes, could have gone to work.” Limitation of the Data – The data may understate the number of employed people because people who have irregular, casual, or unstructured jobs sometimes report themselves as not working. The number of employed people “at work” is probably overstated in the data (and conversely, the number of employed “with a job, but not at work” is understated) since some people on vacation or sick leave erroneously reported themselves as working. This problem has no effect on the total number of employed people. The reference week for the employment data is not the same for all people. Since people can change their employment status from one week to another, the lack of a uniform reference week may mean that the employment data do not reflect the reality of the employment situation of any given week. (For more information, see the discussion under “Reference Week.”) Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some household population. All institutionalized people are placed in the “not in labor force” category. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the population. For example, in areas having a large state prison population, the employment rate would be expected to decrease because the base of the percentage, which now includes the population in correctional institutions, is larger. The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the employment status questions in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for these questions as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering search box. Along with the 2008 ACS release, the Census Bureau produced a research note comparing 2007 and 2008 ACS employment estimates to 2007 and 2008 Current Population Survey (CPS)/Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) estimates. The research note shows that labor force data more consistent with benchmark data from the CPS and LAUS program. For more information, see “Changes to the American Community Survey between 2007 and 2008 and the Effects on the Estimates of Employment and Unemployment” (https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/guidance/labor-force/researchnote- report.pdf). Comparability – Since employment data from the ACS are obtained from respondents in households, they differ from statistics based on reports from individual business establishments, farm enterprises, and certain government programs. People employed at more than one job are counted only once in the ACS and are classified according to the job at which they worked the greatest number of hours during the reference week. In statistics based on reports from business and farm establishments, people who work for more than one establishment may be counted more than once. Moreover, some tabulations may exclude private household workers, unpaid family workers, and self-employed people, but may include workers less than 16 years of age. An additional difference in the data arises from the fact that people who had a job but were not at work are included with the employed in the ACS statistics, whereas many of these people are likely to be excluded from employment figures based on establishment payroll of place of residence regardless of where they work, whereas establishment data report people at their place of work regardless of where they live. This latter consideration is particularly significant when comparing data for workers who commute between areas. For several reasons, the unemployment figures of the Census Bureau are not comparable with published figures on unemployment compensation claims. For example, figures on unemployment compensation claims exclude people who have exhausted their benefit rights, new workers who have not earned rights to unemployment insurance, and people losing jobs not covered by unemployment insurance systems (including some workers in agriculture, domestic services, and religious organizations, and self-employed and unpaid family workers). In addition, the qualifications for drawing unemployment compensation differ from the definition of unemployment used by the Census Bureau. People working only a few hours during the week and people with a job but not at work are sometimes eligible for unemployment compensation but are classified as “Employed” in the ACS. Differences in the geographical distribution of unemployment data arise because the place where claims are filed may not necessarily be the same as the place of residence of the unemployed worker.

Fertility The data on fertility were derived from Question 17 in 1999-2002, Question 18 in 2003-2007, question 23 in 2008, Question 24 in 2009-2018, and Question 25 since 2019 in the American Community Survey (ACS). The question asked if the person had given birth in the past 12 months, and was asked of all women 15 to 50 years old regardless of marital status. From this question, we are able to determine geographies with high numbers of women with births and the characteristics of these women, such as age and marital status. When fertility was not reported, it was imputed according to the woman’s age and marital status and the possibility there was an infant in the household. Data are most frequently presented in terms of the aggregate number of women who had a birth in the past 12 months in the specified category, and in terms of the rate per 1,000 women. Total Fertility Rate- This measure estimates the number of children a group of 1,000 women would have by the end of their childbearing years if they all experienced the same age-specific birth rates between ages 15-50 in a given year. This rate is used for comparisons among different population groups—for example, women in different geographical areas--as the rate accounts for differences in the age distribution in those areas. Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS collected data on “children ever born.” (See the section on “Children Ever Born” for more information.) In 1999, the ACS began collecting data on children born in the last 12 months. Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have fertility distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the fertility distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. Comparability – The data on fertility can be compared to previous ACS years, to data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and to similar data collected in the Current Population Survey (CPS) before that question changed in 2012. Keep in mind there are differences among these that can lead to differences in estimates. For instance, the NCHS collects administrative records while the ACS and CPS estimates are based on survey data. Also, all of these surveys have slightly different ways of determining the reference period, but generally show births occurring over a period of 12 months. Field of Degree Field of degree data are used by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to study the characteristics of the population with science and engineering degrees and occupations. Data on field of bachelor’s degree were derived from answers to Question 12 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). This question was asked only to persons with a bachelor’s degree or higher. Eligible respondents were asked to list the specific major(s) of any bachelor’s degree received. This question does not ask for the field of any other type of degree earned (such as master’s or doctorate). An automated computer system coded write-in responses to Question 12 into 196 areas. Clerical coding categorized any write-in responses that could not be autocoded by the computer. Respondents listing multiple fields were assigned a code for each field, with a maximum of 4 fields per respondent. The majors were further classified into a category scheme detailed in Field of Degree Classification table in Appendix A. Question/Concept History – The field of degree question first appeared in the 2009 ACS. The inclusion of a field of degree question on the ACS was proposed to provide field of degree data annually for small levels of geography and to assist in building a sampling frame for the NSF’s National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG). Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have field of degree distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the field of degree distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population.",

Duration categories ranged from less than 6 months to 5 or more years. Question/Concept History – This set of questions was added to the ACS in 1999 to comply with legislation passed in the 104th Congress requiring that the decennial census program obtain information about grandparents who have primary responsibility for the care of their grandchildren. The response categories for length of time caring for grandchildren were modified slightly between the 1999 and 2000 ACS questionnaires to match the 2000 decennial census questionnaire. The question has remained unchanged since then. Limitation of the Data – Before 2006, ACS grandparents data had a universe of people in households (which was the same as that in Census 2000). Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS.

Existence of a Grandparent Living with a Grandchild in the Household – This was determined by a “Yes” answer to the question, “Does this person have any of his/her own grandchildren under the age of 18 living in this house or apartment?” This question was asked of people 15 years of age and over. Because of the low numbers of persons under 30 years old living with their grandchildren, data were only tabulated for people 30 and over. Responsibility for Basic Needs – This question determines if the grandparent is financially responsible for food, shelter, clothing, day care, etc., for any or all grandchildren living in the household. In selected tabulations, grandparent responsibility is further classified by presence of parent (of the grandchild). Duration of Responsibility – The answer refers to the grandchild for whom the grandparent has been responsible for the longest period of time. Duration categories ranged from less than 6 months to 5 or more years. Question/Concept History – This set of questions was added to the ACS in 1999 to comply with legislation passed in the 104th Congress requiring that the decennial census program obtain information about grandparents who have primary responsibility for the care of their grandchildren. The response categories for length of time caring for grandchildren were modified slightly between the 1999 and 2000 ACS questionnaires to match the 2000 decennial census questionnaire. The question has remained unchanged since then. Limitation of the Data – Before 2006, ACS grandparents data had a universe of people in households (which was the same as that in Census 2000). Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have grandparents as caregivers distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the grandparents as caregivers distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. Comparability – The data on grandparents as caregivers can be compared to previous ACS years and Census 2000 (with the potential limitation noted above about areas with a substantial GQ population). For more information, go to http://www.census.gov and enter “Comparing ACS Data” in the search box. Group Quarters (GQ) See “Group Quarters” in the Living Quarters section. Health Insurance Coverage Data on health insurance coverage were derived from answers to Question 16 in the American Community Survey (ACS), which was asked of all respondents. Respondents were instructed to report their current coverage and to mark “yes” or “no” for each of the eight types listed (labeled as parts 16(a) to 16(h)). a. Insurance through a current or former employer or union (of this person or another family member) b. Insurance purchased directly from an insurance company (by this person or another family member) c. Medicare, for people 65 and older, or people with certain disabilities",

For more information on the logical coverage (eligibility) edits, see “Applying and Evaluating Logical Coverage Edits to Health Insurance Coverage in the American Community Survey” People were considered insured if they reported at least one “yes” to Questions 16a to 16f. People who had no reported health coverage, or those whose only health coverage was Indian Health Service, were considered uninsured. For reporting purposes, the Census Bureau Private health insurance is a plan provided through an employer or union, a plan purchased by an individual from a private company, or TRICARE or other military health care. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in parts a, b, or e were considered to have private health insurance. Public health coverage includes the federal programs Medicare, Medicaid, and VA Health Care (provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs), as well as the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and individual state health plans. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in c, d, or f were considered to have public coverage. The health insurance classifications are not mutually exclusive--people may be covered by more than one at the same time. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other federal agencies, use understand state and local health insurance needs. Question/Concept History – The ACS began asking questions about health insurance coverage in 2008. Because 2008 was the first year of collection, the Census Bureau limited the number and type of data products to simple age breakdowns of overall, private, and public coverage status. The evaluation of the 2008 data suggested that the data were of good quality, so the Census Bureau expanded the data products to include estimates of the specific types of coverage along with estimates about social, economic, and demographic details for people with and without health insurance. new definitions, go to https://www.census.gov/topics/health/health- insurance/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_18. In 2019, the Census Bureau introduced additional questions regarding health insurance premiums and subsidy receipt to estimate subsidized Marketplace coverage and updated the VA coverage question to better reflect the post-ACA climate. civilian noninstitutionalized population. This population excludes active-duty military personnel and the population living in institutional group quarters (GQ) (such as correctional facilities and nursing homes) but includes the population living in noninstitutional group quarters (such as college dormitories). Some noninstitutional group quarter (GQ) populations (e.g., the prevalence of private health insurance among residents of college dormitories is higher than the household population). The proportion of the universe that is in the noninstitutional GQ populations could, therefore, have a noticeable impact on estimates of insurance coverage distributions that are different from the civilian noninstitutionalized population, the distributions in the published tables may differ slightly from how they would look if the total population were represented. thus no equivalent measure is available from previous ACS surveys or Census 2000. data users should be careful as to which 2008 ACS estimates they use to make comparisons. National, state, county and place-level 2008 (1-year) data incorporating the eligibility edit are available for select geographies (https://www.census.gov/topics/health/health- insurance/guidance/acs-2008-1-year-re-run.html); these tables, comparable to the 2009 and later tables, are available at https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/acs/1-year-re-run- health-insurance.html. For more information on the logical coverage (eligibility) edits, see American Community Survey” Because coverage in the ACS references an individual’s current status, caution should be taken when making comparisons to other surveys that may define coverage as “at any time in the last year” or “throughout the past year.” A discussion of how the ACS health insurance estimates relate to other survey health insurance estimates can be found in “A Preliminary (https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2009/acs/2009_Turner_01.html) Hispanic or Latino Origin The data on the Hispanic or Latino population were derived from answers to a question that was asked of all people (Question 5 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS)). The ethnicity classifications used by the U.S. Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). These OMB standards govern the definitions and categories used to collect and present federal data on ethnicity and race. OMB requires two minimum categories on ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino). The 2023 ACS Hispanic origin question included three detailed checkboxes (“Mexican, Mexican Am., or Chicano,” “Puerto Rican,” “Cuban”), along with a “Yes, another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin” checkbox, example groups, and a write-in area to collect additional detailed Hispanic responses. The 2023 ACS instruction stated, “Print, for example, Salvadoran, Dominican, Colombian, Guatemalan, Spaniard, Ecuadorian, etc.” The examples for 2023 are the largest Hispanic population groups representing the geographic diversity of the Hispanic or Latino category, as defined by the 1997 OMB standards. The terms “Hispanic,” “Latino,” and “Spanish” are used interchangeably. Some respondents identify with all three terms while others may identify with only one of these three specific terms. People who identify with the terms “Hispanic,” “Latino,” or “Spanish” are those who classify themselves in one of the specific Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish categories listed on the questionnaire (“Mexican, Mexican Am., or Chicano,” “Puerto Rican,” or “Cuban”) as well as those who indicate that they are “another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin.” People who do not identify with one of the specific origins listed on the questionnaire but indicate that they are “another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin” are those whose origins are from Spain, the Spanish-speaking countries of Central or South America, or another Spanish culture or origin. Origin can be viewed as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person’s parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race. Hispanic origin is used in numerous programs and is vital in making policy decisions. These data are needed to determine compliance with provisions of antidiscrimination in employment and minority recruitment legislation. Under the Voting Rights Act, data about Hispanic origin are essential to ensure enforcement of bilingual election rules. Some tabulations are shown by the origin of the householder. In all cases where the origin of households, families, or occupied housing units is classified as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish, the origin of the householder is used. (For more information, see the discussion of householder under “Household Type and Relationship.”) Note that data collected and tabulated in the 2023 ACS follow OMB’s 1997 Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity. The ACS will be updated in the future to reflect the updates in OMB’s 2024 Revisions to OMB's Statistical Policy Directive No. 15: Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity. Coding of Hispanic Origin Write-in Responses – There were two types of coding operations: (1) automated coding where a write-in response was automatically coded if it matched a write-in response already contained in a database known as the “master file,” and (2) expert coding, which took place when a write-in response did not match an entry already on the master file, and was sent to expert coders familiar with the subject matter. During the coding process, subject-matter specialists reviewed and coded written entries from the “Yes, another Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin” write-in response category on the Hispanic origin question.

During the coding process, subject-matter specialists reviewed and coded written entries from the “Yes, another Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin” write-in response category on the Hispanic origin question. While the 2019 ACS captured up to 30 characters from the write-in line, allowing up to two responses to be coded, starting in 2020 the ACS captured 200 characters, allowing for up to six responses to be coded from the write-in line. Knowing that some respondents may self-identify by reporting multiple Hispanic ethnicities, such as “Cuban\" and \"Salvadoran,\" 2023 ACS entries with multiple detailed Hispanic responses will be collected for research purposes. However, following the OMB standards, only a single Hispanic response will be tabulated, as was done in the 2020 ACS. Editing of Hispanic Origin Responses – If an individual did not provide a Hispanic origin response, their origin was allocated using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if origin was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then either the origin of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder was allocated. If Hispanic origin was not reported for anyone in the household and origin could not be obtained from a response to the race question, then the Hispanic origin of a householder in a previously processed household with the same race was allocated to the individual missing a response. Surnames (Spanish and Non-Spanish) were used to assist in allocating an origin or race. Question/Concept History – Beginning in 1996, the ACS question was worded “Is this person Spanish/Hispanic/Latino?” In 2008, the question wording changed to “Is Person 1 of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin?” From 1999 to 2007, the Hispanic origin question provided an instruction, “Mark (X) the “No” box if not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino.” The 2008 question, as well as the 1996 to 1998 questions, did not have this instruction. In addition, in 2008, the “Yes, another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish” category provided examples of six Hispanic origin groups (Argentinean, Colombian, Dominican, Nicaraguan, Salvadoran, Spaniard, and so on). Although the 2020 ACS Hispanic origin question included the same three detailed checkboxes (“Mexican, Mexican Am., or Chicano” “Puerto Rican,” “Cuban”), along with a “Yes, another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin” checkbox that was included in the 2019 ACS, there were two important changes to the 2020 ACS Hispanic origin question. The instruction to “Print origin, for example” was revised to “Print, for example.” The example groups were revised from “Argentinean, Colombian, Dominican, Nicaraguan, Salvadoran, Spaniard, and so on.” to “Salvadoran, Dominican, Colombian, Guatemalan, Spaniard, Ecuadorian, etc.” in order to represent the largest Hispanic population groups and the geographic diversity of the Hispanic or Latino category, as defined by OMB’s 1997 Standards. Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. Comparability – Changes in estimates may be due to demographic changes, as well as factors including questionnaire changes, differences in ACS population controls, and methodological differences in the population estimates. The ACS question on Hispanic origin was revised in 2008 to make it consistent with the 2010 Census Hispanic origin question. Additional information about the changes in the ACS and their potential effect on the estimates of Hispanic origin can be found in the paper “Changes to the American Community Survey Between 2007 and 2008 and Their Potential Effects on the Estimates of Hispanic Origin Type, Nativity, Race and Language.” Go to http://www.census.gov and enter the paper title in the search box. The ACS question on Hispanic origin was revised in 2020 to make it consistent with the 2020 Census Hispanic origin question. For more information on comparing 2022 estimates to estimates from previous years, go to http://www.census.gov and enter “Comparing ACS Data” in the search box. For more information, see the Hispanic Origin and Race Code List found within the 2023 ACS Code List. Household See Household Type and Relationship. Household Type and Relationship The data on relationship to householder were derived from answers to Question 2 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS), which was asked of all people in housing units. The question on relationship is essential for classifying the population information on families and other groups. Information about changes in the composition of the American family, from the number of people living alone to the number of children living with only one parent, is essential for planning and carrying out a number of federal programs. The responses to this question were used to determine the relationships of all persons to the householder, as well as household type (married couple family, nonfamily, etc.). From responses to this question, we were able to determine numbers of related children, own children, unmarried partner households, and multigenerational households. We calculated average household and family size. When relationship was not reported, it was imputed using the age difference between the householder and the person, sex, and marital status. Household – A household includes all the people who occupy a housing unit. (People not living in households are classified as living in group quarters.) A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other people in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living arrangements. Average Household Size – A measure obtained by dividing the number of people in households by the number of households. In cases where people in households are cross- classified by race or Hispanic origin, people in the household are classified by the race or Hispanic origin of the householder rather than the race or Hispanic origin of each individual. Average household size is rounded to the nearest hundredth. Relationship to Householder Householder – One person in each household is designated as the householder. In most cases, this is the person or one of the people in whose name the home is owned, being bought, or rented and who is listed on line one of the survey questionnaire. If there is no such person in the household, any adult household member 15 years old and over could be designated as the householder. Households are classified by type according to the sex of the householder and the presence of relatives. Two types of householders are distinguished: a family householder and a non-family householder. A family householder is a householder living with one or more individuals related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption. A nonfamily householder is a householder living alone or with non- relatives only. Spouse – Includes a person married to and living with the householder. The categories “same-sex husband/wife/spouse” and “opposite-sex husband/wife/spouse” include people in formal marriages, as well as people in common-law marriages. In tabulations, beginning in 2013, unless otherwise specified, “Spouse” and “married couple” includes same-sex married couples. Child – Includes a son or daughter by birth, a stepchild, or adopted child of the householder, regardless of the child’s age or marital status. The category excludes sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, and foster children. • Biological son or daughter – The son or daughter of the householder by birth. • Adopted son or daughter – The son or daughter of the householder by legal adoption. If a stepson or stepdaughter has been legally adopted by the householder, the child is then classified as an adopted child. • Stepson or stepdaughter – The son or daughter of the householder through marriage but not by birth, excluding sons-in-law and",

In tabulations, beginning in 2013, unless otherwise specified, “Spouse” and “married couple” includes same-sex married couples. Child – Includes a son or daughter by birth, a stepchild, or adopted child of the householder, regardless of the child’s age or marital status. The category excludes sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, and foster children. • Biological son or daughter – The son or daughter of the householder by birth. • Adopted son or daughter – The son or daughter of the householder by legal adoption. If a stepson or stepdaughter has been legally adopted by the householder, the child is then classified as an adopted child. • Stepson or stepdaughter – The son or daughter of the householder through marriage but not by birth, excluding sons-in-law and daughters-in-law. If a stepson or stepdaughter of the householder has been legally adopted by the householder, the child is then classified as an adopted child. Own Child – A never-married child under 18 years who is a son or daughter by birth, a stepchild, or an adopted child of the householder. In certain tabulations, own children are further classified as living with two parents or with one parent only. Own children of the householder living with two parents are by definition found only in married-couple families. (Note: When used in “EMPLOYMENT STATUS” tabulations, own child refers to a never married child under the age of 18 in a family or a subfamily who is a son or daughter, by birth, marriage, or adoption, of a member of the householder’s family, but not necessarily of the householder.) Related Child – Any child under 18 years old who is related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. Related children of the householder include ever- married as well as never-married children. Children, by definition, exclude persons under 18 years who maintain households or are spouses or unmarried partners of householders. Other Relatives – In tabulations, the category “other relatives” includes any household member related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption, but not included specifically in another relationship category. In certain detailed tabulations, the following categories may be shown: • Grandchild – The grandson or granddaughter of the householder. • Brother/Sister – The brother or sister of the householder, including stepbrothers, stepsisters, and brothers and sisters by adoption. Brothers-in- law and sisters-in-law are included in the “Other Relative” category on the questionnaire. • Parent – The father or mother of the householder, including a stepparent or adoptive parent. Fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law are included in the “Parent-in-law” category on the questionnaire. • Parent-in-law – The mother-in-law or father-in-law of the householder. • Son-in-law or daughter-in-law – The spouse of the child of the householder. • Other Relatives – Related by birth, marriage, or adoption, but NOT one of the categories above- for example, niece or nephew. If a foster child is related to the householder, respondents are advised to select the appropriate relative category, such as grandchild, or include in the “Other relative” category. Nonrelatives – This category includes any household member, including foster children, not related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. The following categories may be presented in more detailed tabulations: • Roommate or Housemate – A roommate or housemate is a person who is not related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption, and is not their boyfriend or girlfriend, but who lives in the household. • Unmarried Partner – An unmarried partner is a person who is in an intimate relationship with the householder, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend. An “unmarried partner” can be of the same sex or of the opposite sex as the householder. • Foster Child – A foster child is a person under 21 years old AND involved in the formal foster care system. • Other Nonrelatives – Anyone who is not related by birth, marriage, or adoption to the householder and who is not described by the categories given above. When relationship is not reported for an individual, it is imputed according to the responses for age, sex, and marital status for that person while maintaining consistency with responses for other individuals in the household. Unrelated Individual – An unrelated individual is: (1) a householder living alone or with nonrelatives only, (2) a household member who is not related to the householder, or (3) a person living in group quarters who is not an inmate of an institution. Family Households – A family consists of a householder and one or more other people living in the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All people in a household who are related to the householder are regarded as members of his or her family. A family household may contain people not related to the householder, but those people are not included as part of the householder’s family in tabulations. Thus, the number of family households is equal to the number of families, but family households may include more members than do families. A household can contain only one family for purposes of tabulations. Not all households contain families since a household may be comprised of a group of unrelated people or of one person living alone – these are called nonfamily households. Families are classified by type as either a “married- couple family” or “other family” according to the sex of the householder and the presence of relatives. The data on family type are based on answers to questions on sex and relationship that were asked of all people. • Married-Couple Family – A family in which the householder and his or her spouse are listed as members of the same household. • Other Family: o Male Householder, No Spouse Present – A family with a male householder and no spouse of householder present. o Female Householder, No Spouse Present – A family with a female householder and no spouse of the householder present. Family households and married-couple families include same-sex married couples, beginning with the 2013 data. Average Family Size – A measure obtained by dividing the number of people in families by the total number of families (or family householders). In cases where the measures, “people in family” or “people per family” are cross-tabulated by race or Hispanic origin, the race or Hispanic origin refers to the householder rather than the race or Hispanic origin of each individual. Average family size is rounded to the nearest hundredth. Subfamily – A subfamily is a married couple (husband and wife interviewed as members of the same household) with or without never-married children under 18 years old, or one parent with one or more never-married children under 18 years old. A subfamily does not maintain its own household, but lives in a household where the householder or householder’s spouse is a relative. The number of subfamilies is not included in the count of families, since subfamily members are counted as part of the householder’s family. Subfamilies are defined during processing of data. Same-sex married couples are only shown as the householder and spouse, and are not included in subfamilies. In selected tabulations, subfamilies are further classified by type: married-couple subfamilies, with or without own children; mother-child subfamilies; and father-child subfamilies. In some labor force tabulations, children in both one-parent families and one-parent subfamilies are included in the total number of children living with one parent, while children in both married-couple families and married-couple subfamilies are included in the total number of children living with two parents. Multigenerational Household – Multigenerational households are family households consisting of three or more generations. These households include (1) a householder, a parent or parent-in-law of the householder, and an own child of the householder, (2) a householder, an own child of the householder, and a grandchild of the householder, or (3) a householder, a parent or parent-in-law of the householder, an own child of the householder, and a grandchild of the householder. Nonfamily Household – A householder living alone or with nonrelatives only. Unmarried couples households, whether opposite-sex or same-sex, with no relatives of the householder present are tabulated in nonfamily households. Unmarried-Partner Household – An unmarried-partner household is a household other than a “married-couple household” that includes a householder and an “unmarried partner.” An “unmarried partner” can be of the same sex or of the opposite sex as the householder. An “unmarried partner” in an “unmarried-partner household” is an adult who is unrelated to the householder, but shares living quarters and is in an intimate relationship with the householder. An unmarried-partner household also may be a family household or a nonfamily household, depending on the presence or absence of another person in the household who is related to the householder by birth or adoption. There may be only one unmarried partner per household, and an unmarried partner may not be included in a married- couple household, as the householder cannot have both a spouse and an unmarried partner. Question/Concept History – Between 1996 and 2007, the question response categories remained the same. In 2008, the “Son or daughter” category was expanded to “Biological son or daughter,” “Adopted son or daughter,” and “Stepson or stepdaughter.” Also “In-law” was expanded to “Parent-in-law” and “Son-in-law or daughter-in-law.” In 2019, the “Husband or wife” category was expanded to “Opposite-sex husband/wife/spouse” and “Same-sex husband/wife/spouse” and the “Unmarried partner” category was expanded to “Opposite-sex unmarried partner” and “Same-sex unmarried partner.” The “Roomer or Boarder” category was deleted, and the “Housemate or Roommate” category was reworded to “Roommate or Housemate.” Limitation of the Data – Unlike the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the ACS relationship question does not have a parent pointer to identify whether both parents are present. For example, if a child lives with unmarried parents, we only know the relationship of the child to the householder, not to the other parent. So, a count of children living with two biological parents is not available from these data. Comparability – The relationship categories for the most part can be compared to previous ACS years and to similar data collected in the decennial census, CPS, and SIPP. With the change in 2008 from “In-law” to the two categories of “Parent-in-law” and “Son-in-law or daughter-in-law,” caution should be exercised when comparing data on in-laws from previous years. “In-law” encompassed any type of in-law such as sister-in-law. Combining “Parent-in-law” and “son-in-law or daughter-in-law” does not represent all “in-laws” in 2008. The same can be said of comparing the three categories of “biological” “step,” and “adopted” child in 2008 to “Child” in previous years. Before 2008, respondents may have considered anyone under 18 as “child” and chosen that category. The ACS includes “foster child” as a category. However, the 2010 Census did not contain this category, and “foster children” were included in the “Other nonrelative” category. Therefore, comparison of “foster child” cannot be made to the 2010 Census. Beginning in 2013, the “spouse” category includes same-sex spouses. Household Size Householder Immigrants According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), immigrants are foreign-born persons who obtain legal permanent residence in the United States. DHS is responsible for publishing immigration statistics based on administrative data, such as the number of persons obtaining legal permanent resident status, refugees and asylees, naturalizations, nonimmigrant admissions, and enforcement actions. See Foreign-Born Population. Income in the Past 12 Months The data on income were derived from answers to Questions 43 and 44 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS), which were asked of the population 15 years old and over. “Total income” is the sum of the amounts reported separately for wage or salary income; net self-employment income; interest, dividends, or net rental or royalty income or income from estates and trusts; Social Security or Railroad Retirement income; Supplemental Security Income (SSI); public assistance or welfare payments; retirement, survivor, or disability pensions; and all other income. Receipts from the following sources are not included as income: capital gains, money received from the sale of property (unless the recipient was engaged in the business of selling such property); the value of income “in kind” from food stamps, public housing subsidies, medical care, employer contributions for individuals, etc.; withdrawal of bank deposits; money borrowed; tax refunds; exchange of money between relatives living in the same household; gifts and lump-sum inheritances, insurance payments, and other types of lump- sum receipts. Income is a vital measure of general economic circumstances. Income data are used to determine poverty status, to measure economic well-being, and to assess the need for assistance. These data are included in federal allocation formulas for many government programs. For instance: Social Services: Under the Older Americans Act, funds for food, health care, and legal services are distributed to local agencies based on data about elderly people with low incomes. Data about income at the state and county levels are used to allocate funds for food, health care, and classes in meal planning to low-income women with children. Employment: Income data are used to identify local areas eligible for grants to stimulate economic recovery, run job-training programs, and define areas such as empowerment or enterprise zones.",

Housing: Under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, income data are used to allocate funds to areas for home energy aid. Under the Community Development Block Grant Program, funding for housing assistance and other community development is based on income and other census data. Education: Data about poor children are used to allocate funds to counties and school districts. These funds provide resources and services to improve the education of economically disadvantaged children. In household surveys, respondents tend to underreport income. Asking the list of specific sources of income helps respondents remember all income amounts that have been received, and asking total income increases the overall response rate and thus, the accuracy of the answers to the income questions. The eight specific sources of income also provide needed detail about items such as earnings, retirement income, and public assistance. Income Type in the Past 12 Months The eight types of income reported in the ACS are defined as follows: 1. Wage or salary income: Wage or salary income includes total money earnings received for work performed as an employee during the past 12 months. It includes wages, salary, Armed Forces pay, commissions, tips, piece-rate payments, and cash bonuses earned before deductions were made for taxes, bonds, pensions, union dues, etc. 2. Self-employment income: Self-employment income includes both farm and non-farm self-employment income. Farm self-employment income includes net money income (gross receipts minus operating expenses) from the operation of a farm by a person on his or her own account, as an owner, renter, or sharecropper. Gross receipts include the value of all products sold, government farm programs, money received from the rental of farm equipment to others, and incidental receipts from the sale of wood, sand, gravel, etc. Operating expenses include cost of feed, fertilizer, seed, and other farming supplies, cash wages paid to farmhands, depreciation charges, rent, interest on farm mortgages, farm building repairs, farm taxes (not state and federal personal income taxes), etc. The value of fuel, food, or other farm products used for family living is not included as part of net income. Non-farm self-employment income includes net money income (gross receipts minus expenses) from one’s own business, professional enterprise, or partnership. Gross receipts include the value of all goods sold and services rendered. Expenses include costs of goods purchased, rent, heat, light, power, depreciation charges, wages and salaries paid, business taxes (not personal income taxes), etc.",

Income in the Past 12 Months The data on income were derived from answers to Questions 43 and 44 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS), which were asked of the population 15 years old and over. “Total income” is the sum of the amounts reported separately for wage or salary income; net self-employment income; interest, dividends, or net rental or royalty income or income from estates and trusts; Social Security or Railroad Retirement income; Supplemental Security Income (SSI); public assistance or welfare payments; retirement, survivor, or disability pensions; and all other income.

Data about income at the state and county levels are used to allocate funds for food, health care, and classes in meal planning to low-income women with children. Employment: Income data are used to identify local areas eligible for grants to stimulate economic recovery, run job-training programs, and define areas such as empowerment or enterprise zones. Housing: Under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, income data are used to allocate funds to areas for home energy aid. Under the Community Development Block Grant Program, funding for housing assistance and other community development is based on income and other census data.

Social Security or Railroad Retirement income: Social Security income includes Social Security and U.S. railroad retirement pensions and survivor benefits, permanent disability insurance payments made by the Social Security Administration prior to deductions for medical insurance, and railroad retirement insurance checks from the U.S. government. Medicare reimbursements are not included. 5. Supplemental Security Income (SSI): Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a nationwide U.S. assistance program administered by the Social Security Administration that guarantees a minimum level of income for needy aged, blind, or disabled individuals. The Puerto Rico Community Survey questionnaire asks about the receipt of SSI; however, SSI is not a federally-administered program in Puerto Rico. Therefore, it is probably not being interpreted by most respondents in the same manner as SSI in the United States. The only way a resident of Puerto Rico could have appropriately reported SSI would have been if they lived in the United States at any time during the past 12-month reference period and received",

The Census for people employed in the last five years. The first NAICS was developed in 1997 as an improvement over the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system that had been previously updated from the 1930s through 1987. The NAICS has been updated every five group establishments into industries based on the activities in which they are primarily engaged. The NAICS was created for establishment designations and provides detail about the smallest operating establishment, while data collected from households differ in detail and nature from those obtained from establishment surveys. Because of potential disclosure detail for all categories. As the NAICS changes, the Census Bureau updates its code lists, coding procedures, and data Respondents provide the data for the tabulations by writing in descriptions of the kind of business and business activities they are doing. These write-ins are converted to a code are sent to the clerical staff in the National Processing Center (NPC) in Jeffersonville, Indiana, who assign codes by comparing these descriptions to entries in the Alphabetical occupation/guidance/indexes.html). government functions such as legislative, judicial, administrative, and regulatory activities.

As a result, in 2019, ACS adopted an additional response category of “Active Duty or U.S. Armed Forces or Commissioned Corps” in the Class of Worker occupation questions examples provided on the questionnaire. Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore substantial GQ population. respondent’s current primary job or the most recent job for those who are unemployed or out of the labor force but have worked in the last 5 years.

Although the prevalence of multiple jobs is low, data on class of worker of a respondent. Comparability – used to classify the questionnaire responses. These changes are needed to recognize when new industries emerge, the growth and decline in existing industries, and the desire of analysts, researchers, and other users for more detail in the presentation of the data. Usually, the greatest cause of non-comparability is the movement of a segment from one sector to another. Changes in the nature of jobs, respondent terminology, and refinement of category system thus limit comparability of the data from one year to another, and with other surveys that use older classification systems (see below). classification systems used for the 2000 Census, therefore, the data are comparable.

Journey to Work Place of Work – The data on place of work were derived from answers to Question 31 in 2023 American Community Survey (ACS), which was asked of people who indicated in 2023 ACS Question 30a that they worked at some time during the reference week. (See “Reference Week.”) Data were tabulated for workers 16 years old and over, that is, members of the Armed Forces and civilians who were at work during the reference week. Data on place of work refer to the geographic location at which workers carried out their occupational activities during the reference week. In the ACS, the exact address (number and street name) of the place of work was asked, as well as the place (city, town, or post office); whether the place of work was inside or outside the limits of that city or town; and the county, state or foreign country, and ZIP Code. In the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS), the question asked for the exact address, including the development or condominium name, as well as the place; whether or not the place of work was inside or outside the limits of that city or town; the municipio or U.S. county. Respondents also were asked to “enter Puerto Rico or name of U.S. state or foreign country” and the ZIP Code. If the respondent's employer operated in more than one location, the exact address of the location or branch where he or she worked was requested. When the number and street name were unknown, a description of the location, such as the building name or nearest street or intersection, was to be entered. People who worked at more than one location during the reference week were asked to report the location at which they worked the greatest number of hours. People who regularly worked in several locations each day during the reference week were requested to give the address at which they began work each day. For cases in which daily work did not begin at a central place each day, the respondent was asked to provide as much information as possible to describe the area in which he or she worked most during the reference week. Place-of-work data may show a few workers who made unlikely daily work trips (e.g., workers who lived in New York and worked in California). Such a response may be attributable to people who worked during the reference week at a location that was different from their usual place of work, such as people away from home on business. In areas where the workplace address was geographically coded to the block level, people were tabulated as working inside or outside a specific place based on the location of that address regardless of the response to Question 31c concerning city/town limits. In areas where it was impossible to code the workplace address to the block level, or the coding system was unable to match the employer name and street address responses, people were tabulated as working inside or outside a specific place based on the combination of state, county, ZIP Code, place name, and city limits indicator. The city limits indicator was used only in coding decisions when there were multiple geographic codes to select from, after matching on the state, county, place, and ZIP Code responses. The accuracy of place-of- work data for census designated places (CDPs) may be affected by the extent to which their census names were familiar to respondents, and by coding problems caused by similarities between the CDP name and the names of other geographic jurisdictions in the same vicinity. Place-of-work data are given for selected minor civil divisions (MCDs), (generally cities, towns, and townships) in the 12 strong MCD states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin), based on the responses to the place of work question.

Many towns and townships are regarded locally as equivalent to a place, and therefore, were reported as the place of work. When a respondent reported a locality or incorporated place that formed a part of a township or town, the coding and tabulating procedure was designed to include the response in the total for the township or town. Workplace-based Geography – The characteristics of workers may be shown using either residence-based or workplace-based geography. If you are interested in the number and characteristics of workers living in a specific area, you should use the standard (residence- based) journey-to-work tables. If you are interested in the number and characteristics of workers who work in a specific area, you should use the workplace-based journey-to-work tables. Because place-of-work information for workers cannot always be specified below the place level, the workplace-based tables are presented only for selected geographic areas. Means of Transportation to Work – The data on means of transportation to work were derived from answers to Question 32 in 2023 ACS, which was asked of people who indicated in 2023 ACS Question 30a that they worked at some time during the reference week. (See “Reference Week.”) Means of transportation to work refers to the principal mode of travel or type of conveyance that the worker usually used to get from home to work during the reference week. People who used different means of transportation on different days of the week were asked to specify the one they used most often, that is, the greatest number of days. People who used more than one means of transportation to get to work each day were asked to report the one used for the longest distance during the work trip. The category, “Car, truck, or van,” includes workers using a car (including company cars but excluding taxicabs), a truck of one- ton capacity or less, or a van. The category, “Public transportation,” includes workers who used a bus, subway or elevated rail, long-distance train or commuter rail, light rail, streetcar, or trolley, or ferryboat, even if each mode is not shown separately in the tabulation. “Carro público” is included in the public transportation category in Puerto Rico. The category, “Other means,” includes workers who used a mode of travel that is not identified separately within the data distribution. The category, “Other means,” may vary from table to table, depending on the amount of detail shown in a particular distribution. The means of transportation data for some areas may show workers using modes of public transportation that are not available in those areas (for example, subway or elevated riders in a metropolitan area where there is no subway or elevated service). This result is likely due to people who worked during the reference week at a location that was different from their usual place of work (such as people away from home on business in an area where subway service was available), and people who used more than one means of transportation each day but whose principal means was unavailable where they lived (for example, residents of nonmetropolitan areas who drove to the fringe of a metropolitan area, and took the commuter railroad most of the distance to work). Private Vehicle Occupancy – The data on private vehicle occupancy were derived from answers to Question 33 in 2023 ACS. This question was asked of people who indicated in 2023 ACS Question 30a that they worked at some time during the reference week and who reported in 2023 ACS Question 32 that their means of transportation to work was “Car, truck, or van.” Data were tabulated for workers 16 years old and over, that is, members of the Armed Forces and civilians who were at work during the reference week. (See “Reference Week.”) Private vehicle occupancy refers to the number of people who usually rode to work in the vehicle during the reference week. The category, “Drove alone,” includes people who usually drove alone to work as well as people who were driven to work by someone who then drove back home or to a non-work destination. The category, “Carpooled,” includes workers who reported that two or more people usually rode to work in the vehicle during the reference week. Workers Per Car, Truck, or Van – Workers per car, truck, or van is a ratio obtained by dividing the aggregate number of workers who reported using a car, truck, or van to get to work by the number of such vehicles that they used. Workers per car, truck, or van is rounded to the nearest hundredth. This measure also may be known as “Workers per private vehicle.” Aggregate Number of Vehicles (Car, Truck, or Van) Used in Commuting – The aggregate number of vehicles used in commuting is derived by counting each person who drove alone as occupying one vehicle, each person who reported being in a two-person carpool as occupying one-half of a vehicle, each person who reported being in a three-person carpool as occupying one-third of a vehicle, and so on, then summing all the vehicles. This aggregate is used in the calculation for “workers per car, truck, or van.” Time of Departure to Go to Work – The data on time leaving home to go to work were derived from answers to Question 34 in 2023 ACS. This question was asked of people who indicated in 2023 ACS Question 30a that they worked at some time during the reference week, and who reported in 2023 ACS Question 32 that they worked outside their home. The departure time refers to the time of day that the respondent usually left home to go to work during the reference week. (See “Reference Week.”) Travel Time to Work – The data on travel time to work were derived from answers to Question 35 in 2023 ACS. This question was asked of people who indicated in 2023 ACS Question 30a that they worked at some time during the reference week, and who reported in 2023 ACS Question 32 that they worked outside their home. Travel time to work refers to the total number of minutes that it usually took the worker to get from home to work during the reference week. The elapsed time includes time spent waiting for public transportation, picking up passengers in carpools, and time spent in other activities related to getting to work. (See “Reference Week.”) Aggregate Travel Time to Work (in Minutes) – Aggregate travel time to work is calculated by adding all of the travel times (in minutes) for workers who did not work at home. Aggregate travel times of workers having specific characteristics also are computed. The aggregate travel time is subject to rounding, which means that all cells in a matrix are rounded to the nearest 5 minutes. (For more information, see “Aggregate” under “Derived Measures.”) Mean Travel Time to Work (in Minutes) – Mean travel time to work (in minutes) is the average travel time that workers usually took to get from home to work (one way) during the reference week. This measure is obtained by dividing the total number of minutes taken to get from home to work (the aggregate travel time) by the number of workers 16 years old and over who did not work at home. The travel time includes time spent waiting for public transportation, picking up passengers and carpools, and time spent in other activities related to getting to work. Mean travel times of workers having specific characteristics also are computed. For example, the mean travel time of workers traveling 45 or more minutes to work is computed by dividing the aggregate travel time of workers whose travel times were 45 or more minutes by the number of workers whose travel times were 45 or more minutes. The aggregate travel time to work used to calculate mean travel time to work is rounded. (For more information, see “Aggregate Travel Time to Work (in Minutes).”) Mean travel time is rounded to the nearest tenth of a minute. (For more information on means, see “Derived Measures.”) Time Arriving at Work – The data on time arriving at work from home were derived from answers to Question 34 (Time Leaving Home to Go to Work) and from answers to Question 35 (Travel Time to Work), both in the 2023 ACS. These questions were asked of people who indicated in 2023 ACS Question 30a that they worked at some time during the reference week, and who reported in 2023 ACS Question 32 that they worked outside their home. The arrival time is calculated by adding the travel time to work to the reported time leaving home to go to work. These data are presented with other characteristics of workers at their workplace. (See “Time of Departure to Go to Work” and “Travel Time to Work.”) about commuting patterns and the characteristics of commuter travel. The commuting data are essential for planning highway improvement and developing public transportation services, as well as for designing programs to ease traffic problems during peak periods, conserve energy, reduce pollution, and estimate and project the demand for alternative-fueled vehicles. These data are required to develop standards for reducing work-related vehicle trips and increasing passenger occupancy during peak period of travel. Question/Concept History – Starting in 1999, the ACS questions differ from the 1996-1998 questions in that the labels on the write-in spaces and format of the skip instructions were modified to provide clarifications. Beginning in 2004, the category, “Public transportation” for means of transportation was tabulated to exclude workers who used taxicab as their means of transportation. The 2004 ACS marked the first time that workplace-based tables were released as a part of a standard census data product. Beginning in 2019, several transportation categories provided to respondents in ACS question 32 were modified to reflect contemporary trends and nomenclature. Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the group quarters (GQ) population was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations have place of work distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the place of work distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. The data on place of work is related to a reference week, that is, the calendar week preceding the date on which the respondents completed their questionnaires or were interviewed. This week is not the same for all respondents because data were collected over a 12-month period. The lack of a uniform reference week means that the place-of-work data reported in the survey will not exactly match the distribution of workplace locations observed or measured during an actual work week. The place-of-work data are estimates of people 16 years and over who were both employed and at work during the reference week (including people in the Armed Forces). People who did not work during the reference week but had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent due to illness, bad weather, industrial dispute, vacation, or other personal reasons are not included in the place-of-work data. Therefore, the data on place of work understate the total number of jobs or total employment in a geographic area during the reference week. It also should be noted that people who had irregular, casual, or unstructured jobs during the reference week might have erroneously reported themselves as not working. The address where the individual worked most often during the reference week was recorded on the questionnaire. If a worker held two jobs, only data about the primary job (the job where one worked the greatest number of hours during the preceding week) was requested. People who regularly worked in several locations during the reference week were requested to give the address at which they began work each day. For cases in which daily work was not begun at a central place each day, the respondent was asked to provide as much information as possible to describe the area in which he or she worked most during the reference week. Comparability – This data source is comparable to the decennial censuses prior to 2010 for “reference week” that has some variability, the data do not reflect any single week. Since the ACS data are collected over 12 months, the reference week in ACS has a greater range of or 2020 Census.

Labor Force Status See Employment Status. Language Spoken at Home Language Spoken at Home by the Respondent – Data on language spoken at home were derived from answers to questions 14a and 14b in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). These questions were asked only of persons 5 years of age and older. Instructions mailed with the ACS questionnaire instructed respondents to mark “Yes” on Question 14a if they sometimes or always spoke a language other than English at home, and “No” if the person speaks only English, or if a non-English language is spoken only at school, or is limited to a few expressions or slang. For Question 14b, respondents printed the name of the non-English language they spoke at home. If the person spoke more than one non-English language, accompanying instructions instructed them to report the language spoken most often. If the language spoken most frequently could not be determined, the respondent was instructed to report the language learned first. Questions 14a and 14b referred to languages spoken at home in an effort to measure the current use of languages other than English. This category excluded respondents who spoke a language other than English exclusively outside of the home. Write-in responses to Question 14b were categorized into more than 1300 detailed language codes. In 2016, American Community Survey language codes were standardized based on the International Statistical Organization ISO-639-3 standard. For more information, see the “2016 Language Tables Update” user note. Using an automated computer system, the language coding procedure compared write-in responses with a master computer code list – which contained approximately 190,000 previously coded language names and variants – and then assigned a detailed language category to each write-in response. The computerized matching assured that identical alphabetic entries received the same code. Clerical coding categorized any write-in responses that did not match the computer dictionary. When multiple languages other than English were specified, only the first was coded. The write-in responses represented the names people used for languages they spoke. They may not have matched the names or categories used by linguists. Whenever possible, the write-ins were matched with an ISO-639-3 standardized individual language; however, language families and geographical terms were used if classifying at the individual language level was not possible. Presenting data for all languages is not sensible due to sample size and confidentiality concerns. The Four Group Classifications and Forty-Two Group Classifications of Languages Spoken at Home with Examples table in Appendix A provides an illustration of the content of the classification schemes used to present language data. These four group and forty-two group classifications are used in many standardized data products on data.census.gov. However, many more languages are available in the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) and in detailed tables packages. Languages as small as 10,000 speakers may be included in the PUMS dataset. For more information on the Public Use Microdata Sample, please see the PUMS technical documentation. Household Language – In households where one or more people spoke a language other than English, the household language assigned to all household members was the non- English language spoken by the first person with a non-English language in the following order: householder, spouse, parent, sibling, child, grandchild, in-law, other relative, unmarried partner, housemate or roommate, roomer/boarder, foster child, or other nonrelatives. Therefore, a person who spoke only English may have had a non-English household language assigned during tabulations as a result of living in a household with a non-English household language. If no member of the household age 5 and over speaks a language other than English at home then the household language is English only. Government agencies use information on language spoken at home for their programs that serve the needs of those who have difficulty with English. Under the Voting Rights Act, language is needed to meet statutory requirements for making voting materials available in minority languages. The Census Bureau is directed, using data about language spoken at home and the ability to speak English, to identify minority groups that speak a language other than English and to assess their English-speaking ability. The U.S. Department of Education uses these data to prepare a report to Congress on the social and economic status of children served by different local school districts. State and local agencies concerned with aging develop health care and other services tailored to the language and cultural diversity of the elderly under the Older Americans Act. Question/Concept History – The Language Spoken at Home Questions have changed only once since ACS began. Examples of languages were listed immediately followed the question “What is this language?” in the 1996-1998 questionnaire. Starting in 1999, the list of languages was moved to below the write-in box. In 2016, the code list for languages was standardized to match the International Statistical Organization’s standard ISO-639-3.

This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. The language question is about current use of a non-English language, not about ability to speak another language or the use of such a language in the past. People who speak a language other than English outside of the home are not reported as speaking a language other than English. Similarly, people whose mother tongue is a non-English language but who do not currently use the language at home do not report the language. Some people who speak a language other than English at home may have first learned that language in school. These people are expected to indicate speaking English “Very well.” Comparability – Caution should be taken when comparing language data from the ACS and 1980, 1990, and 2000 Censuses across time. Methodological changes to data collection in 2013 may have affected language data. Users should be aware of these changes when comparing data from 2013 or after to data from before 2013, or when using multi-year ACS data containing data from before and after 2013.

Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Code Lists, Definitions, and Accuracy” in the search box. Marital Status/Marital History The data on marital status and marital history were derived from answers to Questions 21 through 24 in the 2023 ACS. The marital status question is asked to determine the status of the person at the time of interview. Many government programs need accurate information on marital status, such as the number of married women in the labor force, elderly widowed individuals, or young single people who may establish homes of their own. The marital history data enables multiple agencies to more accurately measure the effects of federal and state policies and programs that focus on the well-being of families. Marital history data can provide estimates of marriage and divorce rates and duration, as well as flows into and out of marriage. This information is critical for more refined analyses of eligibility for program services and benefits, and of changes resulting from federal policies and programs. Before 2008, the marital status question was asked of all people. Beginning in 2008, the question on marital status was asked only for people 15 years old and over. People 15 and over are asked whether they are “now married,” “widowed,” “divorced,” “separated,” or “never married.” People in common-law marriages are allowed to report the marital status they considered the most appropriate. When marital status is not reported, it is imputed according to the person’s relationship to the householder, sex, and age. Differences in the number of married males and females occur because there is no step in the weighting process to equalize the weighted estimates of husbands and wives. Never Married – Includes all people who have never been married, including people whose only marriage(s) was annulled. Ever Married – Includes people ever married at the time of interview (including those now married, separated, widowed, or divorced). Now Married, Except Separated – Includes people whose current marriage has not ended through widowhood or divorce (regardless of previous marital history), and who are not currently separated. The category may also include couples who live together or people in common-law marriages if they consider this category the most appropriate. In certain tabulations, currently married people are further classified as “spouse present” or “spouse absent.” Separated – Includes people legally separated or otherwise absent from their spouse because of marital discord. Those without a final divorce decree are classified as “separated.” This category also includes people who have been deserted or who have parted because they no longer want to live together, but who have not obtained a divorce. Widowed – Includes widows and widowers who have not remarried. Divorced – Includes people who are legally divorced and who have not remarried. Those without a final divorce decree are classified as “separated.” Now Married – All people whose current marriage has not ended by widowhood or divorce. This category includes people defined above as “separated.” • Spouse Present – Married people whose wife or husband was reported as a member of the same household, including those whose spouses may have been temporarily absent for such reasons as travel or hospitalization. • Spouse Absent – Married people whose wife or husband was not reported as a member of the same household or people reporting they were married and living in a group quarters facility. o Separated – Defined above. o Spouse Absent, Other – Married people whose wife or husband was not reported as a member of the same household, excluding separated. Included is any person whose spouse was employed and living away from home or in an institution or serving away from home in the Armed Forces. Note that beginning in 2013, same-sex married couples are included in the married spouse present category.",

Included is any person whose spouse was employed and living away from home or in an institution or serving away from home in the Armed Forces. Note that beginning in 2013, same-sex married couples are included in the married spouse present category. Differences between the number of married males and the number of married females occur because some husbands and wives have their usual residence in different areas. Furthermore, husbands and wives do not have the same weights. Same-sex couples also contribute to the differences in the number of men and women who are married. Median Age at First Marriage – The median age at first marriage is calculated indirectly by estimating the proportion of young people who will marry during their lifetime, calculating one-half of this proportion, and determining the age (at the time of the survey) of people at this half-way mark by osculatory interpolation. It does not represent the actual median age of the population who married during the calendar year. It is shown to the nearest tenth of a year. Henry S. Shryock and Jacob S. Siegel outline the osculatory procedure in Methods and Materials of Demography, First Edition (May 1973), Volume 1, pages 291-296. Marital History – Beginning in 2008, people 15 years and over who were ever married (married, widowed, separated, or divorced) were asked if they had been married, widowed, or divorced in the past 12 months. They are asked how many times (once, two times, or three or more times) they have been married, and the year of their last marriage. Question/Concept History – The word “current” was dropped from the 1996-1998 marital status question. Since 1999, the question states, “What is this person’s marital status?” The American Community Survey began providing the median age at first marriage with the 2004 data. Before 2008, the marital status question was asked of all people and only tabulated for those 15 and over. In 2008, marital status was moved from the basic demographic section, at the beginning of the ACS questionnaire, to the detailed person section - a part of the questionnaire where some questions are asked of only people 15 and over. Data on marital history were first collected in 2008 at the request of the Department of Health and Human Services to provide more detailed annual information on the marital history of the population. The marital history questions follow the marital status question on the questionnaire. Beginning in 2013, same-sex married couples were edited and shown as such, so they have a marital status of “now married” and also have marital history data. Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations have marital status distributions that are very different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the marital status distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. Comparability – The data on marital status can be compared to previous ACS years and to similar data collected on CPS and SIPP. Marital status is no longer asked on the Decennial Census. For information on comparing ACS data, go to http://www.census.gov and enter “Comparing ACS Data” in the search box. Marriage and divorce rates, derived from the questions asking whether the person got married or divorced in the last 12 months, are not directly comparable to vital statistics collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. ACS estimates are survey based whereas vital statistics use administrative records. Beginning in 2013, the “now married” category includes same-sex spouses. Means of Transportation to Work See Journey to Work. Migration See Residence 1 Year Ago. Native Population The native population includes anyone who was a U.S. citizen at birth. This includes respondents who indicated they were born in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Marianas, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as those born abroad of at least one U.S. citizen parent. See Citizenship Status. Nativity Nativity status refers to whether a person is native or foreign-born. See Place of Birth. Nativity of Parent Nativity of parent indicates the nativity (native or foreign-born) of the parent(s) of children living in a family or subfamily with one or more parents present in the household. It applies to “own children,” that is, never married children under 18 years of age living with one or more of their parents. (See also “Household Type and Relationship.”) The nativity of the child’s parent(s) is determined by the citizenship status of the parent(s). A person is considered native if he/she is a United States citizen at birth and foreign-born if he/she is not a United States citizen at birth. (See also “Place of Birth.”) Limitation of the Data – Nativity of parent does not provide information about children over the age of 18 who may live in the same household as their parents, or children of any age who live apart from their parents. Comparability – No comparable data were published prior to 2006. However, prior years do include the nativity and relationship data from which “nativity of parent” was created. Occupation Occupation data describe the kind of work the person does on the job. These data are derived from responses to write-in questions that are autocoded and clerically coded by Census Bureau staff, using the Census Occupation Code List developed for Census Bureau household surveys. On the ACS, demographic occupational data are derived primarily from answers to questions 42 e and f. These questions are asked of all people 15 years old and over who had worked in the past 5 years. The text of these questions as they appear in the 2023 ACS questionnaire is as follows: Question 42 e. - What was this person’s main occupation? (For example: 4th grade teacher, entry-level plumber) (Write-in field) Question 42 f. - Describe this person’s most important activities or duties. (For example: instruct and evaluate students and create lesson plans, assemble and install pipe sections and review building plans for work details) (Write-in field) For employed people, the data refer to the person's job during the previous week. For those who worked two or more jobs, the data refer to the job where the person worked the greatest number of hours. For unemployed people and people who are not currently employed but report having a job within the last five years, the data refer to their last job. Coding Procedures – The Census Bureau has maintained its own code list since 1850. Written responses to the occupation questions are coded using the 2018 occupational classification system, which consists of 569 specific occupational categories, including 4 military codes, arranged into 23 major occupational groups for people employed in the last five years. This classification was developed based on the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) Manual 2018, published by the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The SOC classifies paid work or work for profit into occupational categories based on the work performed. Every Census Bureau occupation code crosswalks to an SOC code. In 2010, the Census Occupation Code List included 540 occupation codes. In 2018, it included 570 occupation codes. Between 2010 and 2018, 125 occupation codes were deleted and 155 new occupation codes were added. Respondents provided the data for the tabulations by writing in descriptions of the kind of work and activities they are doing. These write-ins are converted to a code category through automated coding. Cases not autocoded on both industry and occupation are sent to the clerical staff in the National Processing Center (NPC) in Jeffersonville, Indiana, who assign codes by comparing these descriptions to entries in the Alphabetical Index of Industries and Occupations (https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/industry- occupation/guidance/indexes.html).",

It applies to “own children,” that is, never married children under 18 years of age living with one or more of their parents. (See also “Household Type and Relationship.”) The nativity of the child’s parent(s) is determined by the citizenship status of the parent(s). A person is considered native if he/she is a United States citizen at birth and foreign-born if he/she is not a United States citizen at birth. (See also “Place of Birth.”) Limitation of the Data – Nativity of parent does not provide information about children over the age of 18 who may live in the same household as their parents, or children of any age who live apart from their parents. Comparability – No comparable data were published prior to 2006. However, prior years do include the nativity and relationship data from which “nativity of parent” was created. Occupation Occupation data describe the kind of work the person does on the job. These data are derived from responses to write-in questions that are autocoded and clerically coded by Census Bureau staff, using the Census Occupation Code List developed for Census Bureau household surveys. On the ACS, demographic occupational data are derived primarily from answers to questions 42 e and f. These questions are asked of all people 15 years old and over who had worked in the past 5 years. The text of these questions as they appear in the 2023 ACS questionnaire is as follows: Question 42 e. - What was this person’s main occupation? (For example: 4th grade teacher, entry-level plumber) (Write-in field) Question 42 f. - Describe this person’s most important activities or duties. (For example: instruct and evaluate students and create lesson plans, assemble and install pipe sections and review building plans for work details) (Write-in field) For employed people, the data refer to the person's job during the previous week. For those who worked two or more jobs, the data refer to the job where the person worked the greatest number of hours. For unemployed people and people who are not currently employed but report having a job within the last five years, the data refer to their last job. Coding Procedures – The Census Bureau has maintained its own code list since 1850. Written responses to the occupation questions are coded using the 2018 occupational classification system, which consists of 569 specific occupational categories, including 4 military codes, arranged into 23 major occupational groups for people employed in the last five years. This classification was developed based on the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) Manual 2018, published by the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The SOC classifies paid work or work for profit into occupational categories based on the work performed. Every Census Bureau occupation code crosswalks to an SOC code. In 2010, the Census Occupation Code List included 540 occupation codes. In 2018, it included 570 occupation codes. Between 2010 and 2018, 125 occupation codes were deleted and 155 new occupation codes were added. Respondents provided the data for the tabulations by writing in descriptions of the kind of work and activities they are doing. These write-ins are converted to a code category through automated coding. Cases not autocoded on both industry and occupation are sent to the clerical staff in the National Processing Center (NPC) in Jeffersonville, Indiana, who assign codes by comparing these descriptions to entries in the Alphabetical Index of Industries and Occupations (https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/industry- occupation/guidance/indexes.html).",

Some occupation groups are related closely to certain industries. Operators of transportation equipment, farm operators and workers, and healthcare providers account for major portions of their respective industries of transportation, agriculture, and health care. However, the industry categories include people in other occupations. For example, people employed in agriculture include truck drivers and bookkeepers; people employed in the transportation industry include mechanics, freight handlers, and payroll clerks; and people employed in the health care industry include janitors, security guards, and secretaries.

Editing Procedures – Following the coding operation, an edit and allocation process excludes all responses that should not be included in the universe and evaluates the consistency of the remaining responses. The codes for occupation are checked for consistency with the industry and class of worker data provided for that respondent. Occasionally respondents supply occupation descriptions that are not sufficiently specific for precise classification, or they do not report on these questions at all. Certain types of incomplete entries are corrected using the Alphabetical Index of Industries and Occupations. If one or more of the three codes (occupation, industry, or class of worker) is blank after the edit, a code is assigned from a donor respondent who is a “similar” person based on questions such as age, sex, educational attainment, income, employment status, and weeks worked. If all of the labor force and income data are blank, all of these economic questions are assigned from a “similar” person who had provided all the necessary data. Question/Concept History – Occupation data have been collected during decennial censuses since 1850. Starting with the 2010 Census, occupation data is no longer collected during the decennial census. Long form data collection has transitioned to the ACS. The ACS began collecting data on occupation in 1996. The questions on occupation were designed to be consistent with the 1990 Census questions on occupation. In 2016, the ACS underwent content testing for the class of worker, industry, and occupation questions. As a result, in 2019, the ACS implemented changes to the formatting, numbering of questions, and examples for the industry and occupation write-in questions provided on the questionnaire. Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations have occupational distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the occupational distribution in some geographic areas with a substantial GQ population. Data on occupation, industry, and class of worker are collected for the respondent’s current primary job or the most recent job for those who are not employed but have worked in the last 5 years. Other labor force questions, such as questions on earnings or work hours, may have different reference periods and may not limit the response to the primary job. Although",

Usually, the greatest cause of non-comparability is the movement of a segment from one category to another. Changes in the nature of jobs, respondent terminology, and refinement of category composition made these movements by all federal agencies. between 1990 and 2000, see Technical Paper #65: The Relationship Between the 1990 to the code lists for 2000, Census Bureau analysts anticipated the possibility of new codes to four-digit codes.

Persons in Household See Household Type and Relationship. Place of Birth The data on place of birth were derived from answers to Question 7 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). Respondents were asked to select one of two categories: (1) in the United States, or (2) outside the United States. In the ACS, respondents selecting category (1) were then asked to report the name of the state while respondents selecting category (2) were then asked to report the name of the foreign country, or Puerto Rico, Guam, etc. In the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS), respondents selecting category (1) were also asked to report the name of the state, while respondents selecting category (2) were then asked to print Puerto Rico or the name of the foreign country, or U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, etc. People not reporting a place of birth were assigned the state or country of birth of another family member, or were allocated the response of another individual with similar characteristics. People born outside the United States were asked to report their place of birth according to current international boundaries. Since numerous changes in boundaries of foreign countries have occurred in the last century, some people may have reported their place of birth in terms of boundaries that existed at the time of their birth or emigration, or in accordance with their own national preference. The place of birth questions along with the citizenship status question provide essential data for setting and evaluating immigration policies and laws. Knowing the characteristics of immigrants helps legislators and others understand how and to what extent different immigrant groups are integrated. Federal agencies require these data to develop programs for refugees and other foreign-born individuals. Vital information on lifetime migration among states also comes from the place of birth question. Nativity – Information on place of birth and citizenship status was used to classify the population into two major categories: native and foreign-born. Native – The native population includes anyone who was a U.S. citizen at birth. The native population includes those born in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Marianas, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as those born abroad of at least one U.S. citizen parent. The native population is divided into the following groups: people born in the state in which they resided at the time of the survey; people born in a different state, by region; people born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Marianas, or the U.S. Virgin Islands; and people born abroad with at least one U.S. citizen parent. (See also “Citizenship Status.”) Foreign-Born – The foreign-born population includes anyone who was not a U.S. citizen at birth. This includes respondents who indicated they were a U.S. citizen by naturalization or not a U.S. citizen. (See also “Citizenship Status.”) The foreign-born population is shown by selected area, country, or region of birth. The places of birth shown in data products were chosen based on the number of respondents who reported that area or country of birth. Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question asked respondents to write in the U.S. state, territory, commonwealth or foreign country where this person was born. Beginning in 1999, the question asked “Where was this person born?” and provided two check-boxes, each with a write-in space. Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the group quarters (GQ) population was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have place of birth distributions that are different from those of the household population. Consequently, the inclusion of the GQ population could have a noticeable impact on the overall place of birth distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. Comparability– This data source is comparable to the decennial censuses prior to 2010. No place of birth question was asked on the 2010 Census. For more information, see the Place of Birth Code List found within the 2022 ACS Code List. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Code Lists, Definitions, and Accuracy” in the search box.

Place of Birth The data on place of birth were derived from answers to Question 7 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). Respondents were asked to select one of two categories: (1) in the United States, or (2) outside the United States. In the ACS, respondents selecting category (1) were then asked to report the name of the state while respondents selecting category (2) were then asked to report the name of the foreign country, or Puerto Rico, Guam, etc. In the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS), respondents selecting category (1) were also asked to report the name of the state, while respondents selecting category (2) were then asked to print Puerto Rico or the name of the foreign country, or U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, etc. People not reporting a place of birth were assigned the state or country of birth of another family member, or were allocated the response of another individual with similar characteristics. People born outside the United States were asked to report their place of birth according to current international boundaries.

Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months Poverty statistics in American Community Survey (ACS) products adhere to the standards specified by the Office of Management and Budget in Statistical Policy Directive 14. The Census Bureau uses a set of dollar value thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. Further, poverty thresholds for people living alone or with nonrelatives (unrelated individuals) vary by age (under 65 years or 65 years and older). The poverty thresholds for two-person families also vary by the age of the householder. If a family’s total income is less than the dollar value of the appropriate threshold, then that family and every individual in it are considered to be in poverty. Similarly, if an unrelated individual’s total income is less than the appropriate threshold, then that individual is considered to be in poverty. How the Census Bureau Determines Poverty Status In determining the poverty status of families and unrelated individuals, the Census Bureau uses thresholds (income cutoffs) arranged in a two-dimensional matrix. The matrix consists of family size (from one person to nine or more people) cross-classified by presence and number of family members under 18 years old (from no children present to eight or more children present). Unrelated individuals and two-person families are further differentiated by age of reference person (householder) (under 65 years old and 65 years old and over). To determine a person's poverty status, one compares the person’s total family income in the last 12 months with the poverty threshold appropriate for that person's family size and composition (see example below). If the total income of that person's family is less than the threshold appropriate for that family, then the person is considered “below the poverty level,” together with every member of his or her family. If a person is not living with anyone related by birth, marriage, or adoption, then the person's own income is compared with his or her poverty threshold. The total number of people below the poverty level is the sum of people in families and the number of unrelated individuals with incomes in the last 12 months below the poverty threshold. Since ACS is a continuous survey, people respond throughout the year. Because the income questions specify a period covering the last 12 months, the appropriate poverty thresholds are determined by multiplying the base-year poverty thresholds (1982) by the average of the monthly inflation factors for the 12 months preceding the data collection. See the table in Appendix A titled “Poverty Thresholds in 1982, by Size of Family and Number of Related Children Under 18 Years (Dollars),” for appropriate base thresholds. See the table “The Poverty Factors” in Appendix A for the appropriate adjustment based on interview month. For example, consider a family of three with one child under 18 years of age, interviewed in July 2022 and reporting a total family income of $20,000 for the last 12 months (July 2021 to June 2022). The base year (1982) threshold for such a family is $7,765, while the average of the 12 inflation factors is 3.10523. Multiplying $7,765 by 3.10523 determines the",

The base year (1982) threshold for such a family is $7,765, while the average of the 12 inflation factors is 3.10523. Multiplying $7,765 by 3.10523 determines the appropriate poverty threshold for this family type, which is calculated to be $ 24112. Comparing the family’s income of $20,000 with the poverty threshold shows that the family and all people in the family are considered to have been in poverty. The only difference for determining poverty status for unrelated individuals is that the person’s individual total income is compared with the threshold rather than the family’s income. Individuals for Whom Poverty Status is Determined – Poverty status was determined for all people except institutionalized people, people in military group quarters, people in college dormitories, and unrelated individuals under 15 years old. These groups were excluded from the numerator and denominator when calculating poverty rates. Specified Poverty Levels – Specified poverty levels are adjusted thresholds that are obtained by multiplying the official thresholds by specific factor. Using the threshold cited from the previous example (a family of three with one related child under 18 years responding in July 2022), the dollar value at 125 percent of the poverty threshold was $ 30140 ($24112 x 1.25). Income Deficit – Income deficit represents the difference between the total income in the last 12 months of families and unrelated individuals below the poverty level and their respective poverty thresholds. In computing the income deficit, families reporting a net income loss are assigned zero dollars, and for such cases, the deficit is equal to the poverty threshold. This measure provides an estimate of the amount, which would be required to raise the incomes of all poor families and unrelated individuals to their respective poverty thresholds. The income deficit is thus a measure of the degree of the impoverishment of a family or unrelated individual. However, please use caution when comparing the average deficits of families with different characteristics. Apparent differences in average income deficits may, to some extent, be a function of differences in family size. Aggregate Income Deficit – Aggregate income deficit refers only to those families or unrelated individuals who are classified as below the poverty level. It is defined as the group (e.g., type of family) sum total of differences between the appropriate threshold and total family income or total personal income. Aggregate income deficit is subject to rounding, which means that all cells in a matrix are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. (For more information, see “Aggregate” under “Derived Measures.”) Mean Income Deficit – Mean income deficit represents the amount obtained by dividing the aggregate income deficit for a group below the poverty level by the number of families (or unrelated individuals) in that group. (The aggregate used to calculate mean income deficit is rounded. For more information, see “Aggregate Income Deficit.”) As mentioned above, please use caution when comparing mean income deficits of families with different characteristics, as apparent differences may, to some extent, be a function of differences in family size.

Poverty Status of Households in the Past 12 Months Since poverty is defined at the family level and not the household level, the poverty status of the household is determined by the poverty status of the householder. Households are classified as poor when the total income of the householder's family in the last 12 months is below the appropriate poverty threshold. (For nonfamily householders, their own income is compared with the appropriate threshold.) The income of people living in the household who are unrelated to the householder is not considered when determining the poverty status of a household, nor does their presence affect the family size in determining the appropriate threshold. The poverty thresholds vary depending upon three criteria: size of family, number of children, and, for one- and two- person families, age of the householder. Question/Concept History – Derivation of the Current Poverty Measure – When the original poverty definition was developed in 1964 by the Social Security Administration (SSA), it focused on family food consumption. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) used its data about the nutritional needs of children and adults to construct food plans for families. Within each food plan, dollar amounts varied according to the total number of people in the family and the family's composition, that is, the number of children within each family. The cheapest of these plans, the Economy Food Plan, was designed to address the dietary needs of families on an austere budget. Since the USDA’s 1955 Food Consumption Survey showed that families of three or more people across all income levels spent roughly one-third of their income on food, the SSA multiplied the cost of the Economy Food Plan by three to obtain dollar figures for total family income. These dollar figures, with some adjustments, later became the official poverty thresholds. Since the Economy Food Plan budgets varied by family size and composition, so too did the poverty thresholds. For two-person families, the thresholds were adjusted by slightly higher factors because those households had higher fixed costs. Thresholds for unrelated individuals were calculated as a fixed proportion of the corresponding thresholds for two-person families. The poverty thresholds are revised annually to allow for changes in the cost of living as reflected in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The poverty thresholds are the same for all parts of the country; they are not adjusted for regional, state, or local variations in the cost of living. Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. The part of the group quarters population in the poverty universe (for example, people living in group homes or those living in agriculture workers’ dormitories) is many times more likely to be in poverty than people living in households. Direct comparisons of the data would likely result in erroneous conclusions about changes in the poverty status of all people in the poverty universe. Comparability – Because of differences in survey methodology (questionnaire design, method of data collection, sample size, etc.), the poverty rate estimates obtained from ACS data may differ from those reported in the Current Population Survey, Annual Social and Economic Supplement, and those reported in Census 2000. For a comparison of poverty rates and analysis of differences between the ACS and the CPS ASEC, see “A Comparison of the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey” at http://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2006/demo/SEHSD-WP2006-03.html.

Race The data on race were derived from answers to the question on race that was asked of all people (Question 6 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS)). The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race. The racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by OMB. These OMB standards govern the definitions and categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a sixth category, “Some Other Race,” added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races. Based on extensive research and outreach over the past decade, the design of the 2023 ACS race and ethnicity questions provides ways for all respondents to self-identify their detailed identities. Note that data collected and tabulated in the 2023 ACS follow OMB’s 1997 Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity. The ACS will be updated in the future to reflect the updates in OMB’s 2024 Revisions to OMB's Statistical Policy Directive No. 15: Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity. Editing of Race Responses. If an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were allocated using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder were allocated. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, then the race or races of a householder in a previously processed household were allocated. Definitions from OMB guide the Census Bureau in classifying written responses to the race question: White. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as “White” or report responses such as German, Irish, English, Italian, Lebanese, and Egyptian. The category also includes groups such as Polish, French, Iranian, Slavic, Cajun, Chaldean, etc. Black or African American. A person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as “Black or African American” or report responses such as African American, Jamaican, Haitian, Nigerian, Ethiopian, or Somali. The category also includes groups such as Ghanaian, South African, Barbadian, Kenyan, Liberian, Bahamian, etc. American Indian or Alaska Native. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. This category includes people who indicate their race as “American Indian or Alaska Native” or report entries such as Navajo Nation, Blackfeet Tribe, Mayan, Aztec, Native Village of Barrow Inupiat Traditional Government, or Nome Eskimo Community. Respondents who identified themselves as “American Indian or Alaska Native” were asked to report their enrolled or principal tribe. Therefore, tribal data in tabulations reflect the entries reported on the questionnaires. Some of the entries (for example, Metlakatla Indian Community and Umatilla) represent reservations or a confederation of tribes on a reservation. The information on tribe is based on self-identification and therefore does not reflect any designation of federally or state-recognized tribe.

The 2023 ACS included an automated review, computer edit, similar to that used in the 2022 ACS. There were two types of coding operations: (1) automated coding where a write-in response was automatically coded if it matched a write-in response already contained in a database known as the “master file” and (2) expert coding, which took place when a write-in response did not match an entry already on the master file and was sent to expert coders familiar with the subject matter. During the coding process, subject-matter specialists reviewed and coded written entries from the response areas on the the 2019 ACS captured up to 30 characters from each line, allowing two distinct groups to be tabulated from each, the 2023 ACS captured 200 characters, allowing up to six groups to be coded and tabulated from each line. The OMB standards encourage the collection of more detailed information, and facilitating the reporting of detailed racial/ethnic identities for all population groups has been a major objective of the Census Bureau’s research for improving which encourage federal agencies to collect additional detailed data, as long as the data can be aggregated to the minimum OMB categories. Question/Concept History 1996-1998 American Community Survey • preceded the question on Hispanic origin with two intervening questions. • The 1990 Census category, “Black or Negro” was changed to “Black, African Am.” • • “Multiracial” response categories all shared a single write-in area. 1999-2002 American Community Survey • The response category “Black, African Am.” was changed to “Black, African Am., or Negro” to correspond with the Census 2000 response category. • The separate 1990 Census and 1996-1998 ACS response categories “Indian (Amer.),” “Eskimo,” and “Aleut,” were combined into one response category, “American Indian or Alaska Native.” Respondents were asked to “print name of enrolled or principal tribe” on a separate write-in line to correspond with the Census 2000 response category. • The 1990 Asian or Pacific Islander category was separated into two categories, “Asian” and “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.” Also, the six detailed Asian groups were alphabetized; and the three detailed Pacific Islander groups were alphabetized after the Native Hawaiian response category. • The response category “Hawaiian” was changed to “Native Hawaiian.” The response category “Guamanian” was changed to “Guamanian or Chamorro.” The response category “Other Asian/Pacific Islander” was split into two separate response categories, “Other Asian,” and “Other Pacific Islander.” These changes correspond to those in the Census 2000 response categories. • The separate “multiracial” response category was dropped. Rather, respondents were himself/herself to be.” Respondents were allowed to select more than one category for • response categories shared the same write-in area. On the Census 2000 questionnaire, only the “Other Asian” and “Other Pacific Islander” response separate write-in area. 2003-2007 American Community Survey Change • The response category “Black, African Am., or Negro” was changed to “Black or African American.” Puerto Rico Community Survey, started in 2005 • These questions were identical to the questions used in the United States. 2008-2013 American Community Survey • Mark (X) one or more boxes” and the reference to what this person considers him/herself to be was deleted. • The response category “Black or African American” was changed to “Black, African Am., or Negro.” • Examples were added to the “Other Asian” response categories (Hmong, Laotian, Thai, Pakistani, Cambodian, and so on) and the “Other Pacific Islander” response categories (Fijian, Tongan, and so on). 2014 American Community Survey • The response category “Black, African Am., or Negro” was changed to “Black or African Am.” 2015-2019 American Community Survey • 2020 American Community Survey • Write-in response areas were added for the \"White\" and \"Black or African Am.\" racial categories. • Six examples were provided for each of the write-in fields allocated to the \"White,\" \"Black or African Am.,\" and \"American Indian or Alaska Native\" groups. These examples represent some of the largest population groups within the geographically diverse population of each category. • The examples provided for the \"Other Asian\" and \"Other Pacific Islander\" groups have been updated to reflect the changes in population sizes and proportions. • The checkbox category “Guamanian or Chamorro” was changed to “Chamorro.” • better solicit detailed reporting.

Reference Week The data on employment status and journey to work relate to the reference week, that is, the calendar week preceding the date on which the respondents completed their questionnaires or were interviewed. This week is not the same for all respondents since the interviewing was conducted over a 12-month period. The occurrence of holidays during the relative reference week probably had no effect on overall measurement of employment status. Relatives and Nonrelatives See Household Type and Relationship. Residence 1 Year Ago The data on residence 1 year ago were derived from answers to Question 15 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS), which was asked of the population 1 year and older. For the ACS, people who moved from another residence in the United States or Puerto Rico 1 year ago were asked to report the exact address (number and street name); the name of the city, town, or post office; the name of the U.S. county or municipio in Puerto Rico; state or Puerto Rico; and the ZIP Code where they lived 1 year ago. People living outside the United States and Puerto Rico were asked to report the name of the foreign country or U.S. Island Area where they were living 1 year ago. For the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS), people who moved from another residence in Puerto Rico or the United States 1 year ago were asked to report the exact address, including the development or condominium name; the name of the city, town, or post office; the municipio in Puerto Rico (county equivalent) or county in the U.S.; and the ZIP Code where they lived 1 year ago. People living outside Puerto Rico and the United States were asked to report the name of the foreign country or U.S. Island Area where they were living 1 year ago. Residence 1 year ago is used in conjunction with location of current residence to determine the extent of residential mobility of the population and the resulting redistribution of the population across the various states, metropolitan areas, and regions of the country. When no information on previous residence was reported for a person, information for the householder or certain family members, if available, was used to assign a location of residence 1 year ago. All cases of nonresponse or incomplete response that were not assigned a previous residence based on information from the householder or certain family members were allocated the previous residence of another person with similar characteristics who provided complete information. The tabulation category, “Same house,” includes all people 1 year and over who did not move during the past year as well as those who moved and returned to their residence 1 year ago. The category, “Different house in the United States” includes people who lived in the United States 1 year ago but in a different house or apartment from the one they occupied at the time of interview. These movers are then further subdivided according to the type of move. In most tabulations, movers within the U.S. are divided into three groups according to their previous residence: “Different house, same county,” “Different county, same state,” and “Different state.” The last group may be further subdivided into region of residence 1 year ago. An additional category, “Abroad,” includes those whose previous residence was in a foreign country, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marianas, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, including members of the Armed Forces and their dependents. Some tabulations show movers who were residing in Puerto Rico or one of the U.S. Island Areas 1 year ago separately from those residing in foreign countries. In most tabulations, movers within Puerto Rico are divided into two groups according to their residence 1 year ago: “Same municipio” and “Different municipio.” Other tabulations show movers within or between metropolitan areas similar to the stateside tabulations. Residence-1-Year-Ago-Based Geography – The characteristics of movers may be shown using either current residence-based or previous residence-based geography. If you are interested in the number and characteristics of movers living in a specific area, you should use the standard (residence-based) tables.

People living outside Puerto Rico and the United States were asked to report the name of the foreign country or U.S. Island Area where they were living 1 year ago. the extent of residential mobility of the population and the resulting redistribution of the population across the various states, metropolitan areas, and regions of the country. When no information on previous residence was reported for a person, information for the householder or certain family members, if available, was used to assign a location of assigned a previous residence based on information from the householder or certain family members were allocated the previous residence of another person with similar characteristics who provided complete information. The tabulation category, “Same house,” includes all people 1 year and over who did not move during the past year as well as those who moved and returned to their residence 1 year ago. The category, “Different house in the United States” includes people who lived in the United States 1 year ago but in a different house or apartment from the one they occupied at the time of interview. These movers are then further subdivided according to the type of move. In most tabulations, movers within the U.S. are divided into three groups according to their previous residence: “Different house, same county,” “Different county, same state,” and “Different state.” The last group may be further subdivided into region of residence 1 year ago. An additional category, “Abroad,” includes those whose previous residence was in a foreign country, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marianas, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, including members of the Armed Forces and their dependents. Some tabulations show movers who were residing in Puerto Rico or one of the U.S. Island Areas 1 year ago separately from those residing in foreign countries. In most tabulations, movers within Puerto Rico are divided into two groups according to their movers within or between metropolitan areas similar to the stateside tabulations. Residence-1-Year-Ago-Based Geography – The characteristics of movers may be shown using either current residence-based or previous residence-based geography. If you are interested in the number and characteristics of movers living in a specific area, you should use the standard (residence-based) tables. If you are interested in the number and characteristics of movers whose previous residence was in a specific area, you should use the residence-1-year-ago-based tables. Because residence-1-year-ago information for movers cannot always be specified below the place level, the previous residence-based tables are presented only for selected geographic areas. both urban and rural areas. This item provides information on the mobility of our population. Knowing the number and characteristics of movers is essential for federal programs dealing with employment, housing, education, and the elderly. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs develops its mandated projection of the need for hospitals and other veteran benefits for each state with migration data about veterans. The Census Bureau develops state age and Question/Concept History – The 1996-1998 questions asked about residence 5 years ago. Beginning in 1999, the time period was changed to 1 year ago, which reflects the on-going data collection on the ACS, and allows for annual estimates of migration. Beginning in 1999, a separate write-in line and a skip instruction were added for a foreign country response. question. The migration parts (city, county, and state response areas) were also reordered. Beginning in 2003, the numerical order was changed so that part c of this question would not be displayed in a separate column of the questionnaire. Beginning in 2008, a write-in space for street address was included and the questions were reworded on both the ACS and the PRCS so that the geographic specificity is maintained for movers within and between the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Municipio of previous residence in Puerto Rico is available for people living in the United States as a result of this change. For from the 2006 ACS Content Test.

School Enrollment and Type of School School enrollment data are used to assess the socioeconomic condition of school-age children. Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation. Data on school enrollment and grade or level attending were derived from answers to Question 10 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). People were classified as enrolled in school if they were attending a public or private school or college at any time during the 3 months prior to the time of interview. The question included instructions to “include only nursery or preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, home school, and schooling which leads to a high school diploma, or a college degree.” Respondents who did not answer the enrollment question were assigned the enrollment status and type of school of a person with the same age, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino origin whose residence was in the same or nearby area. School enrollment is only recorded if the schooling advances a person toward an elementary school certificate, a high school diploma, or a college, university, or professional school (such as law or medicine) degree. Tutoring or correspondence schools are included if credit can be obtained from a public or private school or college. People enrolled in “vocational, technical, or business school” such as postsecondary vocational, trade, hospital school, and on job training were not reported as enrolled in school. Field interviewers were instructed to classify individuals who were home schooled as enrolled in private school. The guide sent out with the mail questionnaire included instructions for how to classify home schoolers. Enrolled in Public and Private School – Includes people who attended school in the reference period and indicated they were enrolled by marking one of the questionnaire categories for “public school, public college,” or “private school, private college, home school.” The instruction guide defines a public school as “any school or college controlled and supported primarily by a local, county, state, or federal government.” Private schools are defined as schools supported and controlled primarily by religious organizations or other private groups. Home schools are defined as “parental-guided education outside of public or private school for grades 1-12.” Respondents who marked both the “public” and “private” boxes are edited to the first entry, “public.” Grade in Which Enrolled – From 1999-2007, in the ACS, people reported to be enrolled in “public school, public college” or “private school, private college” were classified by grade or level according to responses to Question 10b, “What grade or level was this person attending?” Seven levels were identified: “nursery school, preschool;” “kindergarten;” elementary “grade 1 to grade 4” or “grade 5 to grade 8;” high school “grade 9 to grade 12;” “college undergraduate years (freshman to senior);” and “graduate or professional school (for example: medical, dental, or law school).” In 2008, the school enrollment questions had several changes. “Home school” was explicitly included in the “private school, private college” category. For question 10b the categories changed to the following “Nursery school, preschool,” “Kindergarten,” “Grade 1 through grade 12,” “College undergraduate years (freshman to senior),” “Graduate or professional school beyond a bachelor’s degree (for example: MA or PhD program, or medical or law school).” The survey question allowed a write-in for the grades enrolled from 1-12. Question/Concept History – Since 1999, the ACS enrollment status question (Question 10a) refers to “regular school or college,” while the 1996-1998 ACS did not restrict reporting to “regular” school, and contained an additional category for the “vocational, technical or business school.” The 1996-1998 ACS used the educational attainment question to estimate level of enrollment for those reported to be enrolled in school, and had a single year write-in for the attainment of grades 1 through 11. Grade levels estimated using the attainment question were not consistent with other estimates, so a new question specifically asking grade or level of enrollment was added starting with the 1999 ACS questionnaire. Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population universe in the ACS includes people living in group quarters. Data users may see slight differences in levels of school enrollment in any given geographic area due to the inclusion of this population. The extent of this difference, if any, depends on the type of group quarters present and whether the group quarters population makes up a large proportion of the total population. For example, in areas that are home to several colleges and universities, the percent of individuals 18 to 24 who were enrolled in college or graduate school would increase, as people living in college dormitories are now included in the universe. Comparability – Data about level of enrollment are also collected from the decennial Census and from the Current Population Survey (CPS). ACS data are generally comparable to data from the Census. Although it should be noted that the ACS reference period was 3 months preceding the date of interview, while the Census 2000 reference period was any time since February 1, 2000. For more information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data, please see the School Enrollment Fact Sheet on the Census website (https://www.census.gov/topics/education/school-enrollment/guidance/acs-vs-cps.html). Data on school enrollment also are collected and published by other federal, state, and local government agencies. Because these data are obtained from administrative records of school systems and institutions of higher learning, they are only roughly comparable to data from population censuses and surveys. Differences in definitions and concepts, subject matter covered, time references, and data collection methods contribute to the differences in estimates. At the local level, the difference between the location of the institution and the residence of the student may affect the comparability of census and administrative data because census data are collected from and based on a respondent’s residence.

At the local level, the difference between the location of the institution and the residence of the student may affect the comparability of census and administrative data because census data are collected from and based on a respondent’s residence. Differences between the boundaries of school districts and census geographic units also may affect these comparisons. Sex The data on sex were derived from answers to Question 3 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). Individuals were asked to mark either “male” or “female” to indicate their biological sex. For most cases in which sex was invalid, the appropriate entry was determined from other information provided for that person, such as the person’s given (i.e., first) name and household relationship. Otherwise, sex was allocated from a hot deck. Sex is asked for all persons in a household or group quarters. On the mailout/mailback paper questionnaire for households, sex is asked for all persons listed on the form. This form accommodates asking sex for up to 12 people listed as living or residing in the household for at least 2 months. If a respondent indicates that more people are listed as part of the total persons living in the household than the form can accommodate, telephone center staffers call respondents to obtain sex data for the additional household members during the Failed Edit Follow-up (FEFU) operation. In the internet and Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews (CATI), sex is asked for all persons. In 2006, the ACS began collecting data in group quarters (GQs). This included asking sex for persons living in a group quarters. For additional data collection methodology, please see https://www.census.gov/programs- surveys/acs/. Data on sex are used to determine the applicability of other questions for a particular individual and to classify other characteristics in tabulations. The sex data collected on the forms are aggregated and provide the number of males and females in the population. These data are needed to interpret most social and economic characteristics used to plan and analyze programs and policies. Data about sex are critical because so many federal programs must differentiate between males and females. The U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services are required by statute to use these data to fund, implement, and evaluate various social and welfare programs, such as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Laws to promote equal employment opportunity for women also require census data on sex. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs must use census data to develop its state projections of veterans’ facilities and benefits. For more information on the use of sex data in Federal programs, please see “ACS Handbook of Questions and Current Federal Uses.” Sex Ratio – The sex ratio represents the balance between the male and female populations. Ratios above 100 indicate a larger male population, and ratios below 100 indicate a larger female population. This measure is derived by dividing the total number of males by the total number of females and then multiplying by 100. It is rounded to the nearest tenth. Question/Concept History – Sex has been asked of all persons living in a household since the 1996 ACS Test phase. When group quarters were included in the survey universe in 2006, sex was asked of all persons in group quarters as well. Beginning in 2008, the layout of the sex question response categories was changed to a horizontal side-by-side layout from a vertically stacked layout on the mail paper ACS questionnaire. Limitation of the data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations have sex distributions that are very different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the sex distribution. This is particularly true for a given geographic area, especially areas with a substantial GQ population. The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the sex question in the 2007 ACS Grid-Sequential Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, please see “Effects of Using a Grid Versus a Sequential Form on the ACS Basic Demographic Data.” Comparability – Sex is generally comparable across different data sources and data years. However, data users should still be aware of methodological differences that may exist between different data sources if they are comparing ACS sex data to other data sources, such as Population Estimates or Decennial Census data. For example, the ACS data are that of a respondent-based survey and subject to various quality measures, such as sampling and nonsampling error, response rates, and item allocation. This differs in design and methodology from other data sources, such as Population Estimates, which is not a survey and involves computational methodology to derive intercensal estimates of the population. While ACS estimates are controlled to Population Estimates for sex at the nation, state and county levels of geography as part of the ACS weighting procedure, variation may exist in the sex structure of a population at lower levels of geography when comparing different time periods or comparing across time due to the absence of controls below the county geography level. For more information on ACS data accuracy and weighting procedures, please go to https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/. It also should be noted that although the ACS produces population, demographic, and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

Veteran Status Data on veteran status and period of military service were derived from answers to Questions 27 and 28 on the American Community Survey (ACS). Veteran Status – Answers to this question provide specific information about veterans. Veteran status is used to identify people with active duty military service and service in the military Reserves and the National Guard. Veterans are men and women who have served (even for a short time), but are not currently serving, on active duty in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or the Coast Guard, or who served in the U.S. Merchant Marine during World War II. People who served in the National Guard or Reserves are classified as veterans only if they were ever called or ordered to active duty, not counting the initial training or yearly summer camps. All other civilians are classified as nonveterans. These data are used primarily by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to measure the needs of veterans. While it is possible for 17 year olds to be veterans of the Armed Forces, ACS data products are restricted to the population 18 years and older.

Question/Concept History – For the 1999-2002 ACS, the question was changed to match the Census 2000 item. The response categories were modified by expanding the “No active duty service” answer category to distinguish persons whose only military service was for training in the Reserves or National Guard, from persons with no military experience whatsoever. For the 2003-2012 ACS, the “Yes, on active duty in the past, but not now” category was split into two categories. Veterans were asked whether or not their service ended in the last 12 months. Beginning in 2013, the veteran status question was revised in several ways based on recommendations from previous analysis of the question and a change in data needs for the veterans’ series. First, VA no longer needed the 12-month distinction in veteran classifications, which resulted in collapsing the response options from five to four categories. Second, the revised question eliminated the lead-in “yes” and “no” for each response option. Finally, the response category for Reservists incorporated information from the instructions in the old version of the question, eliminating the need for the instruction to the question itself. Limitation of the Data – There may be a tendency for the following kinds of persons to report erroneously that they served on active duty in the Armed Forces: (a) persons who served in the National Guard or Military Reserves but were never called to Federal duty; (b) civilian employees or volunteers for the USO, Red Cross, or the Department of Defense (or its predecessors, the Department of War and the Department of the Navy); and (c) employees of the Merchant Marine or Public Health Service. Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have period of military service and veteran status distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the period of service and veteran status distributions. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. Comparability – The ACS has two separate questions for veteran status and period of military service, whereas in Census 2000, it was a two-part question. The wording for the veteran status question has remained the same; however, the response categories have changed over time (see the section “Question/Concept History”). While the response categories differ slightly from those in Census 2000, data from the two questions can still be compared to one another.",

Finally, the response category for Reservists incorporated information from the instructions in the old version of the question, eliminating the need for the instruction to the question itself. Limitation of the Data – There may be a tendency for the following kinds of persons to report erroneously that they served on active duty in the Armed Forces: (a) persons who served in the National Guard or Military Reserves but were never called to Federal duty; (b) civilian employees or volunteers for the USO, Red Cross, or the Department of Defense (or its predecessors, the Department of War and the Department of the Navy); and (c) employees of the Merchant Marine or Public Health Service. Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have period of military service and veteran status distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the period of service and veteran status distributions. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. Comparability – The ACS has two separate questions for veteran status and period of military service, whereas in Census 2000, it was a two-part question. The wording for the veteran status question has remained the same; however, the response categories have changed over time (see the section “Question/Concept History”).

Veteran Status Data on veteran status and period of military service were derived from answers to Questions 27 and 28 on the American Community Survey (ACS). Veteran Status – Answers to this question provide specific information about veterans. Veteran status is used to identify people with active duty military service and service in the military Reserves and the National Guard. Veterans are men and women who have served (even for a short time), but are not currently serving, on active duty in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or the Coast Guard, or who served in the U.S. Merchant Marine during World War II. People who served in the National Guard or Reserves are classified as veterans only if they were ever called or ordered to active duty, not counting the initial training or yearly summer camps. All other civilians are classified as nonveterans. These data are used primarily by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to measure the needs of veterans. While it is possible for 17 year olds to be veterans of the Armed Forces, ACS data products are restricted to the population 18 years and older. Veteran Status is: • Used at state and county levels to plan programs for medical and nursing home care for veterans. • Used by VA to plan the locations and sizes of veterans’ cemeteries. • Used by local agencies, under the Older Americans Act, to develop health care and other services for elderly veterans. • Used to allocate funds to states and local areas for employment and job training programs for veterans under the Job Training Partnership Act. Question/Concept History – For the 1999-2002 ACS, the question was changed to match the Census 2000 item. The response categories were modified by expanding the “No active duty service” answer category to distinguish persons whose only military service was for training in the Reserves or National Guard, from persons with no military experience whatsoever. For the 2003-2012 ACS, the “Yes, on active duty in the past, but not now” category was split into two categories. Veterans were asked whether or not their service ended in the last 12 months. Beginning in 2013, the veteran status question was revised in several ways based on recommendations from previous analysis of the question and a change in data needs for the veterans’ series. First, VA no longer needed the 12-month distinction in veteran classifications, which resulted in collapsing the response options from five to four categories.

Period of Military Service – People who indicate that they had ever served on active duty in the past or were currently on active duty are asked to indicate the period or periods in which they served. Currently, there are 9 periods of service on the ACS questionnaire. Respondents are instructed to mark a box for each period in which they served, even if just for part of the period. The periods were determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and generally alternate between peacetime and wartime. The responses to this question are edited for consistency and reasonableness. The edit eliminates inconsistencies between reported period(s) of service and age of the person; it also removes reported combinations of periods containing unreasonable gaps (for example, it will not accept a response that indicated the person had served in World War II and in the Vietnam era, but not in the Korean conflict). Period of military service distinguishes veterans who served during wartime periods from those whose only service was during peacetime. Questions about period of military service provide necessary information to estimate the number of veterans who are eligible to receive specific benefits. Question/Concept History – In 1999, the response categories were modified by closing the “August 1990 or later (including Persian Gulf War)” period at March 1995, and adding the “April 1995” or later category. For the 2001-2002 ACS question, the response category was changed from “Korean conflict” to “Korean War.” For the 2003-2012 ACS, the response categories for the question were modified in several ways. The first category “April 1995 or later” was changed to “September 2001 or later” to reflect the era that began after the events of September 11, 2001; the second category “August 1990 to March 1995” was then expanded to “August 1990 to August 2001 (including Persian Gulf War).” The category “February 1955 to July 1964” was split into two categories: “March 1961 to July 1964” and “February 1955 to February 1961.” To match the revised dates for war-time periods of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the dates for the “World War II” category were changed from “September 1940 to July 1947” to “December 1941 to December 1946,” and the dates for the “Korean War” were changed from “June 1950 to January 1955” to “July 1950 to January 1955.” To increase specificity, the “Some other time” category was split into two categories: “January 1947 to June 1950” and “November 1941 or earlier.” Beginning in 2013, the period of military service question was revised to make the categories more meaningful to VA needs. The “September 1980 to July 1990” and “May 1975 to August 1980” categories were collapsed into “May 1975 to July 1990.” The “March 1961 to July 1964” and “February 1955 to February 1961” categories were collapsed into “February 1955 to July 1964.” Limitation of the Data – There may be a tendency for people to mark the most recent period in which they served or the period in which they began their service, but not all periods in which they served. Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population. Comparability – Since Census 2000, the period of military service categories on the ACS questionnaire were updated to: 1) include the most recent period “September 2001 or later;” 2) alternate “peace time” periods and “wartime periods” in the list; and 3) update the Korean War and World War II dates to match the official dates as listed in U.S. Code, Title 38. While the response categories differ slightly from those in Census 2000, data from the two questions can still be compared to one another. For comparisons to Census 2000 and earlier ACS data, go to http://www.census.gov and enter “Comparing ACS Data” in the search box. Due to an editing error, the veteran's period of service recode (VPS) prior to 2007 was being incorrectly assigned for some individuals. The majority of the errors misclassified some people who reported only serving during the Vietnam Era as having served in the category “Gulf War and Vietnam Era.” The remainder of the errors misclassified some people who reported only serving between the Vietnam Era and Gulf War as having served in the category “Gulf War.” The Group Quarters (GQ) population was included in the 2006 ACS and not included in prior years of ACS data, thus comparisons should be made only if the geographic area of interest does not include a substantial GQ population.

Service-Connected Disability Status and Ratings – Data on service-connected disability- rating status and service-connected disability ratings were derived from answers to Questions 29a and 29b in the 2019 ACS. Service-Connected Disability-Rating Status – People who indicated they had served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces, military Reserves, or National Guard, or trained with the Reserves or National Guard or were now on active duty were asked to indicate whether they had a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) service-connected disability rating. These disabilities are evaluated according to the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities in Title 38, U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Part 4. “Service-connected” means the disability was a result of disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active military service. VA uses a priority system to allocate health care services among veterans enrolled in its programs. Data on service-connected disability status and ratings are used to measure the demand for VA health care services in local market areas across the country as well as to classify veterans into priority groups for VA health care enrollment. Question/Concept History – This question was added to the ACS in 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Service-Connected Disability” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Service-Connected Disability” in the search box. Limitation of the Data – There may be a tendency for people to erroneously report having a 0 percent rating when they have no service-connected disability rating at all. Comparability – The question was not asked in Census 2000. It was added to the ACS in 2008. Service-Connected Disability Rating – This question is asked of people who reported having a VA service-connected disability rating. These ratings are graduated according to degrees of disability on a scale from 0 to 100 percent, in increments of 10 percent. The ratings determine the amount of compensation payments made to the veterans. A zero-rating, which is different than having no rating at all, means a disability exists but it is not so disabling that it entitles the veteran to compensation payments. VA uses a priority system to allocate health care services among veterans enrolled in its programs. Data on service-connected disability status and ratings are used to measure the demand for VA health care services in local market areas across the country as well as to classify veterans into priority groups for VA health care enrollment.

Work Experience The data on work experience were derived from answers to Questions 39, 40, and 41 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). This term relates to work status in the past 12 months, weeks worked in the past 12 months, and usual hours worked per week worked in the past 12 months. To comply with provisions of the Civil Rights Act, the U.S. Department of Justice uses these data to determine the availability of individuals for work. Government agencies, in considering the programmatic and policy aspects of providing federal assistance to areas, have emphasized the requirements for reliable data to determine the employment resources available. Data about the number of weeks and hours worked last year are essential because these data allow the characterization of workers by full-time/part-time and full-year/part-year status. Data about working last year are also necessary for collecting accurate income data by defining the universe of persons who should have earnings as part of their total income. Work Status in the Past 12 Months The data on work status in the past 12 months were derived from answers to Question 39 in the 2023 ACS. People 16 years old and over who worked 1 or more weeks according to the criteria described below are classified as “Worked in the past 12 months.” All other people 16 years old and over are classified as “Did not work in the past 12 months.” Weeks Worked in the Past 12 Months The data on weeks worked in the past 12 months were derived from responses to Question 40 in the 2023 ACS, which was asked of people 16 years old and over who indicated that they worked during the past 12 months. The data pertain to the number of weeks during the past 12 months in which a person did any work for pay or profit (including paid vacation and paid sick leave) or worked without pay on a family farm or in a family business. Weeks of active service in the Armed Forces are also included. Usual Hours Worked Per Week Worked in the Past 12 Months The data on usual hours worked per week worked in the past 12 months were derived from answers to Question 41 in the 2023 ACS. This question was asked of people 16 years old and over who indicated that they worked during the past 12 months. The data pertain to the number of hours a person usually worked during the weeks worked in the past 12 months. The respondent was to report the number of hours worked per week in the majority of the weeks he or she worked in the past 12 months. If the hours worked per week varied considerably during the past 12 months, the respondent was to report an approximate average of the hours worked per week. People 16 years old and over who reported that they usually worked 35 or more hours each week during the weeks they worked are classified as “Usually worked full time;” people who reported that they usually worked 1 to 34 hours are classified as “Usually worked part time.” Aggregate Usual Hours Worked Per Week in the Past 12 Months – Aggregate usual hours worked is the sum of the values for usual hours worked each week of all the people in a particular universe. (For more information, see “Aggregate” under “Derived Measures.”) Mean Usual Hours Worked Per Week in the Past 12 Months – Mean usual hours worked is the number obtained by dividing the aggregate number of hours worked each week of a particular universe by the number of people in that universe. For example, mean usual hours worked for workers 16 to 64 years old is obtained by dividing the aggregate usual hours worked each week for workers 16 to 64 years old by the total number of workers 16 to 64 years old. Mean usual hours worked values are rounded to the nearest one-tenth of an hour. (For more information, see “Mean” under “Derived Measures.”) Full-Time, Year-Round Workers – All people 16 years old and over who usually worked 35 hours or more per week for 50 to 52 weeks in the past 12 months.

      "definition": "2023 American Community Survey (ACS). This term relates to work status in the past 12 months, weeks worked in the past 12 months, and usual hours worked per week worked in the past 12 months. To comply with provisions of the Civil Rights Act, the U.S. Department of Justice uses these data to determine the availability of individuals for work. Government agencies, in considering the programmatic and policy aspects of providing federal assistance to areas, have emphasized the requirements for reliable data to determine the employment resources available. Data about the number of weeks and hours worked last year are essential because these data allow the characterization of workers by full-time/part-time and full-year/part-year status. Data about working last year are also necessary for collecting accurate income data by defining the universe of persons who should have earnings as part of their total income. Work Status in the Past 12 Months The data on work status in the past 12 months were derived from answers to Question 39 in the 2023 ACS. People 16 years old and over who worked 1 or more weeks according to the criteria described below are classified as “Worked in the past 12 months.” All other people 16 years old and over are classified as “Did not work in the past 12 months.” Weeks Worked in the Past 12 Months The data on weeks worked in the past 12 months were derived from responses to Question 40 in the 2023 ACS, which was asked of people 16 years old and over who indicated that they worked during the past 12 months. The data pertain to the number of weeks during the past 12 months in which a person did any work for pay or profit (including paid vacation and paid sick leave) or worked without pay on a family farm or in a family business. Weeks of active service in the Armed Forces are also included. Usual Hours Worked Per Week Worked in the Past 12 Months The data on usual hours worked per week worked in the past 12 months were derived from answers to Question 41 in the 2023 ACS. This question was asked of people 16 years old and over who indicated that they worked during the past 12 months. The data pertain to the number of hours a person usually worked during the weeks worked in the past 12 months. The respondent was to report the number of hours worked per week in the majority of the weeks he or she worked in the past 12 months. If the hours worked per week varied considerably during the past 12 months, the respondent was to report an approximate average of the hours worked per week. People 16 years old and over who reported that they usually worked 35 or more hours each week during the weeks they worked are classified as “Usually worked full time;” people who reported that they usually worked 1 to 34 hours are classified as “Usually worked part time.” Aggregate Usual Hours Worked Per Week in the Past 12 Months – Aggregate usual hours worked is the sum of the values for usual hours worked each week of all the people in a particular universe. (For more information, see “Aggregate” under “Derived Measures.”) Mean Usual Hours Worked Per Week in the Past 12 Months – Mean usual hours worked is the number obtained by dividing the aggregate number of hours worked each week of a particular universe by the number of people in that universe. For example, mean usual hours worked for workers 16 to 64 years old is obtained by dividing the aggregate usual hours worked each week for workers 16 to 64 years old by the total number of workers 16 to 64 years old. Mean usual hours worked values are rounded to the nearest one-tenth of an hour. (For more information, see “Mean” under “Derived Measures.”) Full-Time, Year-Round Workers – All people 16 years old and over who usually worked 35 hours or more per week for 50 to 52 weeks in the past 12 months. Number of Workers in Family in the Past 12 Months – The term “worker” as used for these data is defined based on the criteria for work status in the past 12 months. Question/Concept History – Beginning in 2008, the weeks worked question was separated into 2 parts: part (a) asked whether the respondent worked 50 or more weeks in the past 12 months and part (b) asked respondents who answered ‘no’ to part (a) how many weeks they worked, even for a few hours. Limitation of the Data – It is probable that the number of people who worked in the past 12 months and the number of weeks worked are understated since there is some tendency for respondents to forget intermittent or short periods of employment or to exclude weeks worked without pay. There may also be a tendency for people not to include weeks of paid vacation among their weeks worked; one result may be that the ACS figures understate the number of people who worked “50 to 52 weeks.” The ACS data refer to the 12 months preceding the date of interview. Since not all people in the ACS were interviewed at the same time, the reference period for the ACS data is neither fixed nor uniform. Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable substantial GQ population. The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the weeks worked question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008.

Work Status in the Past 12 Months Year of Entry The data on year of entry were derived from answers to Question 9 in the 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). This question was asked about Persons 1 through 5 in the ACS and was restricted to those persons who on Question 8 answered that they were in citizenship categories (2) born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or Northern Marianas; (3) born abroad of U.S. citizen parent or parents; (4) U.S. citizen by naturalization; or (5) not a U.S citizen. All respondents born outside the United States were asked for the year in which they came to live in the United States. This includes people born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Marianas, or the U.S. Virgin Islands; people born abroad of at least one U.S. citizen parent; and the foreign-born. (See “Citizenship Status.”) For the Puerto Rico Community Survey, respondents born outside Puerto Rico were asked for the year in which they came to live in Puerto Rico. The responses to this question indicate when persons born outside the U.S. came to live in the United States. Question/Concept History – Since 1996, the year of entry questions for the ACS and for the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS) have been identical. An instruction was added beginning in 1999 to “Print numbers in boxes.” In 2015, this instruction was changed to “If this person came to live in the United States more than once, print latest year” for ACS and “If this person came to live in Puerto Rico more than once, print latest year” for PRCS. Limitation of the Data – Respondents were directed to indicate the year they entered the U.S. “to live” (or “to live” in Puerto Rico, for PRCS). For respondents who entered the U.S. (or entered Puerto Rico for PRCS) multiple times, the interviewers were instructed to request the most recent year of entry. For respondents who entered multiple times and did not ask the interviewer for clarification or who mailed back the questionnaire without being interviewed in person, it is unclear which year of entry was provided (i.e. first or most recent). Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have year of entry distributions that are different from those of the household population. Consequently, the inclusion of the GQ population could have a noticeable impact on the overall year of entry distribution. This is particularly true for areas with substantial GQ populations. Comparability – Year of entry was comparable across ACS years. A note of caution when comparing ACS and Census 2000 year of entry data: Census 2000 represents data collected as of April 1, 2000 and thus the “2000” year of entry category accounts only for the first quarter (Jan-Mar) in 2000. In comparison, the ACS represents data collected throughout the entire year and thus the “2000” year of entry category accounts for the entire year of 2000.

Derived Measures Census data products include various derived measures, such as medians, means, and percentages, as well as certain rates and ratios. Most derived measures that round to less than 0.1 are shown as zero. Aggregate See “Mean.” Average See “Mean.” Gini Index The Gini is a measure of how much a distribution varies from a proportionate distribution. A purely proportionate distribution would have every value in the distribution being equal (that is 20% of the values would equal 20% of the aggregate total of all the values). This also is known as “perfect equality” – all households have an equal share of income. An example of a distribution that deviates the most from perfect equality would have every value except one equal to zero, and one value that would be equal to the nonzero aggregate total for all the values. This also is known as “perfect inequality” – one household has all income. The Gini ranges from zero (perfect equality) to one (perfect inequality), and it is calculated by measuring the difference between a diagonal line (the purely proportionate distribution) and the distribution of actual values (a Lorenz curve). This measure is presented for household income. Interpolation Interpolation is frequently used to calculate medians, quartiles, or quintiles and to approximate standard errors from tables based on interval data. Different kinds of interpolation may be used to estimate the value of a function between two known values, depending on the form of the distribution. The most common distributional assumption is that the data are linear, resulting in linear interpolation. Mean This measure represents an arithmetic average of a set of values. It is derived by dividing the sum (or aggregate) of a group of numerical questions by the total number of questions in that group. For example, mean household earnings is obtained by dividing the aggregate of all earnings reported by individuals with earnings living in households by the total number of households with earnings. (Additional information on means and aggregates is included in the separate explanations of many population and housing variables.) Aggregate. An aggregate is the sum of the values for each of the elements in the universe. For example, aggregate household income is the sum of the incomes of all households in a given geographic area. Means are derived by dividing the aggregate by the appropriate universe. When an aggregate used as a numerator is rounded in the detailed (base) tables, the rounded value is used for the calculation of the mean. Rounding for selected aggregates. To protect the confidentiality of responses, the aggregates shown in matrices for the list of subjects below are rounded. This means that the aggregates for these subjects, except for travel time to work, are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. Unless special rounding rules apply (see below); $150 rounds up to $200; $149 rounds down to $100; $100 stays $100 unless otherwise noted. Note that each cell in a matrix is rounded individually. This means that an aggregate value shown for the United States may not necessarily be the sum total of the aggregate values in the matrices for the states. This also means that the cells in the aggregate matrices may not add to the total and/or subtotal lines. Special rounding rules for aggregates. – If the dollar value is –$99 through +$99, then the dollar value is rounded to $0. – If the dollar value is less than –$100, then the dollar value is rounded to the nearest -$100. – If the dollar value is $100 or -$100, do not change the value.

The most common distributional assumption is Mean This measure represents an arithmetic average of a set of values. It is derived by dividing the sum (or aggregate) of a group of numerical questions by the total number of questions in that group. For example, mean household earnings is obtained by dividing the aggregate of all earnings reported by individuals with earnings living in households by the total number of households with earnings. (Additional information on means and aggregates is included in the separate explanations of many population and housing variables.) Aggregate. An aggregate is the sum of the values for each of the elements in the universe. For example, aggregate household income is the sum of the incomes of all households in a given geographic area. Means are derived by dividing the aggregate by the appropriate universe. When an aggregate used as a numerator is rounded in the detailed (base) tables, the rounded value is used for the calculation of the mean. Rounding for selected aggregates. To protect the confidentiality of responses, the aggregates shown in matrices for the list of subjects below are rounded. This means that the aggregates for these subjects, except for travel time to work, are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. Unless special rounding rules apply (see below); $150 rounds up to $200; $149 rounds down to $100; $100 stays $100 unless otherwise noted. Note that each cell in a matrix is rounded individually. This means that an aggregate value shown for the United States may not necessarily be the sum total of the aggregate values in the matrices for the states. This also means that the cells in the aggregate matrices may not add to the total and/or subtotal lines. Special rounding rules for aggregates. – If the dollar value is –$99 through +$99, then the dollar value is rounded to $0. – If the dollar value is less than –$100, then the dollar value is rounded to the nearest -$100. – If the dollar value is $100 or -$100, do not change the value.

Aggregate Average Gini Index The Gini is a measure of how much a distribution varies from a proportionate distribution. A purely proportionate distribution would have every value in the distribution being equal (that is 20% of the values would equal 20% of the aggregate total of all the values). This also is known as “perfect equality” – all households have an equal share of income. An example of a distribution that deviates the most from perfect equality would have every value except one equal to zero, and one value that would be equal to the nonzero aggregate total for all the values. This also is known as “perfect inequality” – one household has all income. The Gini ranges from zero (perfect equality) to one (perfect inequality), and it is calculated by measuring the difference between a diagonal line (the purely proportionate distribution) and the distribution of actual values (a Lorenz curve). This measure is presented for household income. Interpolation Interpolation is frequently used to calculate medians, quartiles, or quintiles and to approximate standard errors from tables based on interval data. Different kinds of interpolation may be used to estimate the value of a function between two known values, depending on the form of the distribution. The most common distributional assumption is that the data are linear, resulting in linear interpolation. This measure represents an arithmetic average of a set of values.

For example, Gross Rent includes aggregates of payments for “contract rent” and the “costs of utilities and fuels.” Selected Monthly Owner Costs includes aggregates of payments for “mortgages, deeds of trust, contracts to purchase, or similar debts on the property (including payments for the first mortgage, second mortgage, home equity loans, and other junior mortgages); real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood insurance on the property, and the costs of utilities and fuels.”] [**Note: Aggregate Travel Time to Work is zero if the aggregate is zero, is rounded to 4 minutes if the aggregate is 1 to 7 minutes, and is rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 minutes for all other values (if the aggregate is not already evenly divisible by 5).] Median This measure represents the middle value (if n is odd) or the average of the two middle values (if n is even) in an ordered list of n data values. The median divides the total frequency distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median and one-half above the median. Each median is calculated using a standard distribution (see below). (For more information, see “Interpolation.”) For data products displayed in data.census.gov, medians that fall in the upper-most category of an open-ended distribution will be shown with a plus symbol (+) appended (e.g., “$3,500+” for contract rent), and medians that fall in the lowest category of an open-ended distribution will be shown with a minus symbol (-) appended (e.g., “$100- for contract rent”). For other data products and data files that are downloaded by users (i.e., FTP files), plus and minus signs will not be appended. Contract Rent, for example will be shown as $3501 if the median falls in the upper-most category ($3,500 or more) and $99 if the median falls in the lowest category (Less than $100). (The “Median Standard Distributions” section in Appendix A shows the open-ended intervals for medians.) Standard Distributions. In order to provide consistency in the values within and among data products, standard distributions from which medians and quartiles are calculated are used for the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS “Median Standard Distributions” are listed in Appendix A. Percentage This measure is calculated by taking the number of questions in a group possessing a characteristic of interest and dividing by the total number of questions in that group, and then multiplying by 100. Quartile This measure divides a distribution into four equal parts. The first quartile (or lower quartile) is the value that defines the upper limit of the lowest one-quarter of the cases. The second quartile is the median. The third quartile (or upper quartile) is defined as the upper limit of the lowest three quarters of cases in the distribution. Quartiles are presented for certain financial characteristics such as housing value and contract rent. The distribution used to compute quartiles is the same as that used to compute medians for that variable. Quintile This measure divides a distribution into five equal parts. The first quintile (or lowest quintile) is the value that defines the upper limit of the lowest one-fifth of the cases. The second quintile is the 40th percentile. The third quintile is the 60th percentile. The fourth quintile is defined as the upper limit of the lowest four fifths of cases in the distribution, or the 80th percentile. Quintiles are presented for household incomes. Rate This is a measure of occurrences in a given period of time divided by the possible number of occurrences during that period. For example, the homeowner vacancy rate is calculated by dividing the number of vacant units “for sale only” by the sum of owner-occupied units and vacant units that are “for sale only,” and then multiplying by 100. Rates are sometimes presented as percentages. Ratio This is a measure of the relative size of one number to a second number expressed as the quotient of the first number divided by the second. For example, the sex ratio is calculated by dividing the total number of males by the total number of females, and then multiplying by 100.",

The total resident population includes persons in both housing units and group quarters. In addition, a coverage rate that includes only the group quarters population is calculated at the national level. Coverage rates for housing units are calculated at the national and state level, except for Puerto Rico because independent housing unit estimates are not available for Puerto Rico. These rates are weighted to reflect the probability of selection into the sample, the subsampling for personal visit follow-up, and non-response adjustment. Response Rates is complete to the estimate of all units that should have been interviewed. Separate rates are calculated for housing unit response and GQ person response. For housing units, this means all interviews after mail, Internet, telephone and personal visit follow-up. For GQ persons, this means all interviews after the personal visit. Interviews include complete and partial interviews with enough information to be processed. All final noninterviews have been grouped into one of the following Reasons for Noninterviews: Refusal: Even though the ACS is a mandatory survey and households whose addresses are selected and GQ persons who are selected for the survey are required to answer the survey questions, a few are reluctant to cooperate and refuse to participate.",

In addition, a coverage rate that includes only the group quarters population is calculated at the national level. Coverage rates for housing units are calculated at the national and state level, except for Puerto Rico because independent housing unit estimates are not available for Puerto Rico. These rates are weighted to reflect the probability of selection into the sample, the subsampling for personal visit follow-up, and non-response adjustment. Response Rates The survey response rate is the ratio of the estimate of units interviewed after data collection is complete to the estimate of all units that should have been interviewed. Separate rates are calculated for housing unit response and GQ person response. For housing units, this means all interviews after mail, Internet, telephone and personal visit follow-up. For GQ persons, this means all interviews after the personal visit. Interviews include complete and partial interviews with enough information to be processed. All final noninterviews have been grouped into one of the following Reasons for Noninterviews: Refusal: Even though the ACS is a mandatory survey and households whose addresses are selected and GQ persons who are selected for the survey are required to answer the survey questions, a few are reluctant to cooperate and refuse to participate.",

      "definition": "Measures describing the quality of the American Community Survey (ACS) sample and the data collected by the ACS – including sample sizes, coverage rates, and response rates – are available for 2000 through the current data year on the ACS web page, at http://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample_size_and_data_quality. The quality measures illustrate the steps the Census Bureau takes to ensure that ACS survey data are accurate and reliable. Quality measures are available for 2010 and later through data.census.gov. Go to data.census.gov and enter “B98” for the full list or a specific table ID in the search box. Sample Size Initially Selected Housing Unit Addresses – The number of addresses in each state and for the nation that were selected for the ACS sample for a particular year. Each year's sample is systematically divided into 12 monthly samples for ACS interviewing. This initial number includes addresses later determined to be commercial or nonexistent, as well as housing units that are not interviewed due to subsampling for personal visit follow-up, refusals, or other reasons. Housing Unit Final Interviews – The final number of interviews across all three modes of data collection for the ACS in a given year. This number includes occupied and vacant housing units that were interviewed by internet, mail, telephone, or personal visit methods between January 1 - December 31. It excludes addresses determined to be nonexistent or commercial, and addresses not selected in the subsample for personal visit follow-up, and addresses that are not interviewed due to refusals or other reasons. Group Quarters Person Initial Sample Selected – The number of people living in GQs that could be contacted for ACS interviewing in a given year for a given geographic area. Each year's sample is systematically divided into 12 monthly samples for ACS interviewing. This initial number includes people thought to be in group quarters that were later determined to be out of scope or nonexistent, as well as people not interviewed due to the group quarter refusing entry, the person refusing to respond, or other reasons. Group Quarters People Final Actual Interviews – The final number of actual person interviews for the ACS for those living in group quarters in a given year for a given geographic area. Group Quarters People Synthetic Final Interviews - The final number of synthetic person interviews for the ACS in a given year, for the nation and by state. See the Group Quarters section for more information. Coverage Rates There are two kinds of coverage error: under-coverage and over-coverage. Under-coverage exists when housing units or people do not have a chance of being selected in the sample. Over-coverage exists when housing units or people have more than one chance of selection in the sample, or are included in the sample when they should not have been. If the characteristics of under-covered or over-covered housing units or individuals differ from those that are selected, the ACS may not provide an accurate picture of the population. The coverage rates measure coverage error in the ACS. The coverage rate is the ratio of the ACS population or housing estimate of an area or group to the independent estimate for that area or group, times 100. Coverage rates for the total resident population are calculated by sex at the national, state, and Puerto Rico levels, and at the national level only for total Hispanics, and non-Hispanics crossed by the five major race categories: White, Black, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.

Unable to Locate: If the interviewer cannot find the sample address after using all possible sources, they consider it “unable to locate.” For GQ persons, the individual could not be located. No One Home: Interviewers assign this code if they could not find anyone at the housing unit during the entire month's interview period. There is no equivalent rate for GQ persons. Temporarily Absent: The interviewers confirm that all household members or the GQ person are away during the entire month's interview period on vacation, a business trip, or caring for sick relatives. Language Problem: The interviewer could not conduct an interview because of language barriers, was not able to get an interpreter who could translate, and the supervisor or regional office could not help complete this case. Insufficient Data: To be considered an interviewed unit in ACS, a household or GQ person's response needs to have a minimum amount of data. Occupied housing units and GQ persons not meeting this minimum are treated as noninterviews in the estimation process. Responses for vacant housing units are not subject to a minimum data requirement. Maximum Contact Attempts Reached: This is a new category introduced in 2016 due to a change in the housing unit personal interviewing process. After the maximum number of contact attempts across all data collection mode has been reached, the interviewer discontinues follow-up attempts for the case. Other: Unique situations when the reason for noninterview does not fit into one of the classifications described above. Possible reasons include “death in the family,” “household quarantined,” or “roads impassable.” Whole GQ Refusal: Some group quarters refuse to allow the ACS to interview any of their residents, citing legal or other reasons. Whole GQ Other: These account for other situations where no one in the GQ was interviewed due to reasons other than refusals. Allocation Rates Missing data for a particular question or item is called item nonresponse. It occurs when a respondent fails to provide an answer to a required item. The ACS also considers invalid answers as item nonresponse.
