## STRATEGIC PIVOT EVOLUTION: Ontology Strategy Refined

### Original Discovery: Official Statistical Ontologies 
- Found COOS, STATO, and Census Address ontologies
- Pivoted from custom ontology building to leveraging authoritative sources

### Current Implementation: Practical Ontology Strategy
**What Actually Works:**
- **COOS Community Ontology** - 6 concepts successfully extracted and usable
- **`cendata:` Extension Namespace** - Clean approach for our custom concepts
- **Hand-coded Geographic Micro-Ontology** - Essential regional mappings only

**What Got Backlogged:**
- STATO methodology integration (Sprint 4)
- Census Address PDF parsing (hand-coded regions instead)
- Neo4j graph complexity (SQLite + ChromaDB sufficient for 200 concepts)

### The Complete Vision (Updated)
```
Human Language → COOS + cendata: → Enhanced Mappings → Census Variables → tidycensus → Data
    ("poverty rate")  (coos:PovertyRate)     (B17001_002E/001E)     (tidycensus API)
```

## TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS

### LLM Mapping Pipeline Enhancements

#### 1. Advanced Candidate Selection Algorithm
```python
# Concept-specific keyword mapping with smart prioritization
concept_keywords = {
    "medianhouseholdincome": ["B19013", "median household income"],
    "povertyrate": ["B17001", "poverty status"],
    "educationalattainment": ["B15003", "B15002", "educational attainment"],
    # ... comprehensive mapping for all major concepts
}

# Base table prioritization (B17001 vs B17001A)
# Summary variable boosting (_001E, _002E get priority)
# Poverty-specific variable boosting (B17001_001E/002E)
```

#### 2. Rate Calculation Expertise
- **Proper numerator/denominator identification**
- **Enhanced prompting for rate concepts**
- **Calculation notes generation**
- **Statistical method classification**

#### 3. Namespace Strategy Implementation
```ttl
@prefix cendata: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brockwebb/census-mcp-server/main/ontology#>
@prefix coos: <https://linked-statistics.github.io/COOS/coos.html#>

# Future concepts will use cendata: for collision-free extensions
```
